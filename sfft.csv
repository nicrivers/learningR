Parliament,Session,speech
41st,2nd,"16 October 2013 Ottawa, Ontario"
41st,2nd,5 :02 p.m.
41st,2nd,"Honourable Senators, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and gentlemen,"
41st,2nd,Let us begin this day together by honouring in silent reflection those whose lives were tragically taken at Lac- MÃ©gantic.
41st,2nd,"I come before you today as one proud Canadian among a vast nation of these, sincere in congratulation on this opening day of the Second Session of the Forty-first Parliament of Canada. I bear the happy wishes and deep affection of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, whose family has this year been blessed with the birth of Prince George."
41st,2nd,"Parliamentarians, you gather today with the high confidence and higher expectation of Canadians. Remember that our nation has embraced a unique set of indelible qualities that must guide your deliberations in this Parliament."
41st,2nd,"Consider this: we are inclusive. We are 35 million people gathered from every part of the world. We welcome the contribution of all those who inhabit this land - from the first of us to the latest among us. This year, we celebrate the 250th anniversary of the Royal Proclamation. This extraordinary document is part of the legal foundation of our country. It recognized the rights of Aboriginal people in Canada for the first time and established the basis of their relations with the Crown."
41st,2nd,"Consider this: we are honourable. People of peace, we use our military power sparingly; but when we do so we do so with full conviction, gathering our forces as men and women who believe that the freedoms we enjoy cannot be taken from us. This clarity focuses our might in terrible times. And wherever and whenever we unleash that might, we raise our grateful voices and our prayers to honour those who have stood in harm's way for us."
41st,2nd,"Consider this: we are selfless. Our survival has been sustained by humility and acceptance of our mutual interdependence. Giving lies in our very nature, certain in our hearts that none but the gift passed from an open hand will multiply as those we help better themselves, those they love and, at length, the country they call home."
41st,2nd,"Consider this: we are smart. We deplore self-satisfaction, yearning rather for self-improvement. We love learning and cherish our right to it. We are united, prosperous and free precisely because we ensure that Canadians have opportunities to learn, excel, advance, and thus to contribute."
41st,2nd,"Consider this: we are caring. Our abiding concern for the common good of our neighbours - in each community - makes us responsive. We do not abandon our fellows to scrape by in times of distress or natural disaster. Inspired by our common bond, we come swiftly and resiliently to the aid of those in need."
41st,2nd,"Today, as we contemplate our 150th anniversary, the eyes and ears and expectations of Canadians turn toward this Parliament, in trust that those who stand here in their place will relentlessly advance and uphold ideas that are inclusive, honourable, selfless, smart and caring at every turn without fail."
41st,2nd,"Let us not disappoint. And with that spirit and direction, let us turn now to the present."
41st,2nd,"Two and a half years ago, Canadians gave our Government a strong mandate: a mandate to protect jobs and our economy; a mandate to keep taxes low; a mandate to make our families and communities safe."
41st,2nd,"Despite ongoing uncertainty and instability from beyond our shores, our Government remains focused on these priorities. We made tough choices - the right choices for Canadian families. The results are clear: more Canadians have good jobs than ever before; families are paying lower taxes; our financial house is in order."
41st,2nd,"As the world looks to recovery, a rare opportunity now lies before us as Canadians: the opportunity to build on our ingenuity, our immense natural wealth, and our values and stability; the opportunity to secure the future, for our generation, and our children's generation. It is the opportunity to lead the world in security and prosperity - not for the sake of doing so, but so that Canadian families who work hard, pay their taxes and play by the rules can get ahead."
41st,2nd,This is Canada's moment; together we will seize it.
41st,2nd,"And as we do, we draw inspiration from our founders, leaders of courage and audacity. Nearly 150 years ago, they looked beyond narrow self-interest. They faced down incredible challenges - geographic, military, and economic. They were undaunted. They dared to seize the moment that history offered. Pioneers, then few in number, reached across a vast continent. They forged an independent country where none would have otherwise existed."
41st,2nd,In the words of Thomas D'Arcy McGee:
41st,2nd,"""I see in the not remote distance one great nationality bound, like the shield of Achilles, by the blue rim of ocean. I see it quartered into many communities, each disposing of its internal affairs, but all bound together by free institutions...''"
41st,2nd,"With hard work, sacrifice and common sense, those Canadian men and women built this country. In so doing, they founded a constitutional democracy, among the most enduring history has known. As we look to the 150th anniversary of our Confederation, we are reminded that ours is a rich inheritance: a legacy of freedom; the birthright of all humanity and the courage to uphold it; the rule of law, and the institutions to protect it; respect for human dignity and diversity."
41st,2nd,"Guided by these values, we Canadians - Aboriginal, French, English, people from all corners of the globe - strive together for our families and a brighter future. We are on the cusp of a moment that is uniquely Canada's."
41st,2nd,"Just as our founders dared, so too must we."
41st,2nd,"We must seize this moment to secure prosperity, for Canadians now, and the generations to follow."
41st,2nd,Creating jobs and securing economic growth is and will remain our Government's top priority.
41st,2nd,"When disaster struck the world economy, our Government's decisive and pragmatic leadership navigated Canada through the worst global recession in a generation."
41st,2nd,"Even before the recession hit, our Government was prepared. It maintained budget surpluses and paid down billions from the national debt. It lowered taxes for Canadians and job-creating businesses."
41st,2nd,"During the downturn, our Government's Economic Action Plan took the steps necessary to safeguard our economy. It protected Canadian jobs. It invested in infrastructure and productivity. And it controlled spending, while maintaining growing transfers that support health care, education and retirement."
41st,2nd,"In spite of continuing risks from beyond our shores, our Government is leading the world by example. It secured the commitment of the world's largest economies to put in place credible plans to achieve financial sustainability. And it set clear targets to bring our own deficit down. Canada now leads the G-7 - in job creation; in income growth; and in keeping debt levels low."
41st,2nd,Canada is now among only a few countries in the world with a triple-A credit rating.
41st,2nd,By taking decisive action Canada has stayed strong where others have faltered. But we cannot be complacent. The global economy still faces significant risks from factors that we do not control. We must stay the course. And sound management remains our Government's guide.
41st,2nd,Canadian families know they cannot prosper by continually spending more than they earn. Our Government is no different.
41st,2nd,"Just as our Government manages debt, so too is it tackling spending. Every day, Canadian families make tough choices about how to spend their hard-earned money. Guided by this example, our Government will continue reducing the size and cost of Government to ensure that taxpayers get value for money."
41st,2nd,"Canadians want good, well-paying, stable jobs. And our country needs Canadians working."
41st,2nd,Canadians know that businesses create jobs. So our Government lowered their tax burden and cut red tape.
41st,2nd,"Canada now has the best job creation record in the G-7 - one million net new jobs since the depths of the recession. These are overwhelmingly full-time, well-paying, private sector jobs."
41st,2nd,But our Government is not stopping here.
41st,2nd,Canada has one of the best-educated workforces in the world. But there are too many people without jobs and too many jobs without people.
41st,2nd,"From the days of the coureurs des bois and the Hudson's Bay Company, Canada has been a trading nation. Today, with one in five Canadian jobs dependent on exports, our prosperity hinges on opening new markets for Canadian goods, services and investment."
41st,2nd,"This is why our Government launched the most ambitious trade agenda in Canadian history. In less than seven years, Canada has concluded new free-trade agreements with nine countries and our Government is negotiating further agreements involving more than 60 others."
41st,2nd,"Since Canada's earliest days, our economy has been built on our abundant natural resources. Directly and indirectly, the natural resource sector employs 1.8 million Canadians, many in skilled, high-paying jobs. Resource development generates 30 billion dollars annually in revenue that supports health care, education and programs Canadians cherish."
41st,2nd,"Canada's energy reserves are vast - sufficient to fuel our growing economy and supply international customers for generations to come. However, for Canadians to benefit fully from our natural resources we must be able to sell them. A lack of key infrastructure threatens to strand these resources at a time when global demand for Canadian energy is soaring."
41st,2nd,"We must seize this moment. The window for gaining access to new markets will not remain open indefinitely. Now more than ever, our future prosperity depends on responsible development of these resources. At the same time, our Government has taken action to ensure that Canada's resources do not fall under foreign government control."
41st,2nd,"Our Government believes, and Canadians expect, that resource development must respect the environment. Our Government's plan for responsible resource development includes measures to protect against spills and other risks to the environment and local communities. Our Government will:"
41st,2nd,"Canada was built on the work of farmers, fishermen, and foresters. They work hard to feed our families and sustain rural communities."
41st,2nd,Our Government will continue to protect and promote Canada's traditional industries.
41st,2nd,"Infrastructure investment creates jobs, supports trade, drives productivity and contributes in a fundamental way to growth and long-term prosperity."
41st,2nd,"For Canadians balancing the pressures of work and daily life, investment in our roads, bridges and transportation networks means less congestion, shorter commutes and more time with family. That's why, in Economic Action Plan 2013, our Government launched the new Building Canada Plan, the largest long-term federal commitment to infrastructure in Canadian history."
41st,2nd,"Our Government's leadership in science and technology helps Canadian business remain competitive while creating high-paying jobs. Since 2006, our Government has invested more than 9 billion dollars to support science, technology and innovative companies operating at the outer limits of knowledge."
41st,2nd,Canada now leads G-7 countries in post-secondary research investment.
41st,2nd,Canada's spectacular beauty attracts visitors from across the globe to every region of our country. These visitors create jobs and sustain local economies. Our Government will continue to work with industry partners to promote Canada as a top destination for tourism.
41st,2nd,Our Government has reduced the red tape burden on small and medium-sized businesses. There are now fewer regulations and the cost of red tape has been reduced by nearly 20 million dollars annually.
41st,2nd,"Canadians work hard for their money. And we know families are better placed to make spending decisions than governments. That is why our Government has lowered taxes, year after year - for families, for businesses, for each and every Canadian."
41st,2nd,"For example, our Government:"
41st,2nd,"Overall, the federal tax burden is at its lowest level in half a century. As a result of our Government's low-tax plan, the average Canadian family now pays 3,200 dollars less in taxes every year. Our Government has a proven record of cutting taxes for Canadian families. We have delivered on our promises. And, once the budget is balanced, our Government is committed to greater tax relief for Canadian families."
41st,2nd,"Canadian families work hard to make ends meet, and every dollar counts. While companies will look out for their bottom line, our Government is looking out for everyday Canadians."
41st,2nd,"When Canadians make decisions about how to spend their money, they must be assured of a voice, a choice, and fair treatment. For example, although Canadians are among the most digitally connected in the world, we also pay some of the highest wireless rates in the developed world. As families know - especially families with teenagers - the monthly bills add up."
41st,2nd,"Our Government has already taken action to achieve greater competition. Canadians know that competition is good for everyone. Competition lowers prices and keeps businesses from becoming complacent. As a result, wireless rates have fallen nearly 20 per cent since 2008."
41st,2nd,But there is much more work to do.
41st,2nd,And our Government will take additional action to protect Canadian consumers. Canadians are tired of hidden fees. They deserve to know the real cost of paying by debit or credit card. And they should not be charged more in Canada for identical goods that sell for less in the United States.
41st,2nd,Our Government will:
41st,2nd,"Our Government believes that the justice system exists to protect law-abiding citizens and our communities. For too long, the voices of victims have been silenced, while the system coddled criminals. Our Government has worked to re- establish Canada as a country where those who break the law are punished for their actions; where penalties match the severity of crimes committed; where the rights of victims come before the rights of criminals."
41st,2nd,"Families are the cornerstone of our society. Families raise our children and build our communities. As our families succeed, Canada succeeds."
41st,2nd,"Our Government understands the daily pressures ordinary Canadian families face. And it is working to strengthen families, not replace them. That's why our Government took money from bureaucrats and lobbyists and gave it to the real experts on child care - mom and dad. Our Government's Universal Child Care Benefit provides 1,200 dollars a year to parents to help with the costs of raising kids."
41st,2nd,Our Government will also support hard-working Canadian families in other ways.
41st,2nd,Our Government will also:
41st,2nd,"Canadian families expect safe and healthy communities in which to raise their children. They want to address poverty and other persistent social problems, access safe and reliable infrastructure, and enjoy a clean and healthy environment."
41st,2nd,Our Government will:
41st,2nd,"Since before Confederation, Canada has relied on railways for the movement of goods and passengers. It is no different today. New economic opportunities still require rail to link Canadian goods to waiting markets."
41st,2nd,The first responders and ordinary Canadians who came together to confront the recent disasters in Lac-MÃ©gantic and Alberta showed courage under the most dire circumstances. The Government has always stood with communities in times of crisis and recovery.
41st,2nd,Government has no higher obligation than the protection of national sovereignty and the security of citizens. And Canadians know that you cannot earn respect by projecting weakness. Serious countries have serious capabilities.
41st,2nd,"Look at the paintings that adorn this room - scenes of the Great War. They remind us of this, and of the profound sacrifices made by our men and women in uniform. These heroes are the pride of our country and the backbone of our history."
41st,2nd,"After a decade of darkness, our Government has been living up to our promise to give the Canadian military the tools it needs to get the job done. Soldier for soldier, sailor for sailor, airman for airman, the Canadian Armed Forces are once again the best in the world."
41st,2nd,"No longer does Canada have to hitch a ride with our allies. Our serving men and women can now carry out their vital missions. The Royal Canadian Air Force is flying new heavy-lift C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft, and operating Chinook helicopters. New tanks, artillery and other equipment have proven their worth in combat. Canadian workers at Canadian shipyards will build new ships for the Royal Canadian Navy and the Canadian Coast Guard. And our Government will complete our plan to replace Canada's fleet of fighter jets."
41st,2nd,"Building on these successes, our Government will renew our Canada First Defence Strategy. Now and in the future, Canada's Armed Forces will defend Canada and protect our borders; maintain sovereignty over our Northern lands and waters; fight alongside our allies to defend our interests; and respond to emergencies within Canada and around the world."
41st,2nd,"To be effective, our military must have more teeth and less tail. Our Government will:"
41st,2nd,"As our Government takes these steps, it will always keep faith with those who have defended Canada with pride. Our veterans have stood up for us; we will stand by them. Our Government has made unprecedented investments to support our veterans."
41st,2nd,Our Government has:
41st,2nd,Our Government has worked to help returning veterans re-establish themselves. We will:
41st,2nd,"We are a northern country. We are a northern people. Canada's greatest dreams are to be found in our highest latitudes. They are the dreams of a North confident and prosperous, the True North, strong and free."
41st,2nd,Our Government is securing our Northern sovereignty; promoting prosperity for Northerners; protecting our Arctic environmental heritage; and giving the people of the North a greater say in their own affairs.
41st,2nd,Our Government has made great strides by:
41st,2nd,But the eyes of the world increasingly look enviously to our North. Our Government will not rest.
41st,2nd,"Canada stands for what is right and good in the world. This is the true character of Canadians - honourable in our dealings, faithful to our commitments, loyal to our friends. Confident partners, courageous warriors and compassionate neighbours."
41st,2nd,"Canada does not go along to get along. Our Government defends Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, the lone outpost of freedom and democracy in a dangerous region. And our Government stands opposed to those regimes that threaten their neighbours, slaughter their citizens, and imperil freedom. These regimes must ultimately be judged not by their words, but by their actions."
41st,2nd,"Canada seeks a world where freedom - including freedom of religion, the rule of law, democracy and human dignity are respected. Our Government will continue to promote these fundamental values around the world, including through the newly established Office of Religious Freedom."
41st,2nd,And Canadians know that freedom and prosperity march together.
41st,2nd,"Canadians also know that free and healthy societies require the full participation of women. Canada has taken a leadership role in addressing the health challenges facing women, infants and children in the world's poorest countries. These efforts are saving millions of lives."
41st,2nd,"It is the reality of our country that Canadians of very different origins live and work side by side, together. New Canadians work hard to learn our languages, our values, and our traditions, and in turn, are welcomed as equal members of the Canadian family. Our Government inherited a broken immigration system, and has worked hard to fix it."
41st,2nd,Our Government has:
41st,2nd,But there is still more our Government can and will do.
41st,2nd,Canadians understand that citizenship should not be simply a passport of convenience. Citizenship is a pledge of mutual responsibility and a shared commitment to values rooted in our history.
41st,2nd,"As we look confidently to the future, we draw great strength from our past. Beginning with our Aboriginal peoples, Canada's story is one of risk, sacrifice, and rugged determination. From the founding of New France, to the fight for Canada in the War of 1812; from the visionary achievement of Confederation, to our victory at Vimy Ridge, Canadians have repeatedly triumphed over long odds to forge a great country, united and free."
41st,2nd,"It is a story we recall with wonder and recount with pride. A story of how different provinces founded a federation in which our distinct strengths advance our unity. A federation in which Canada's two national languages position us uniquely in the world; where francophones thrive and celebrate a unique culture, in solidarity with fellow Canadians."
41st,2nd,Our Government has recognized the QuÃ©bÃ©cois as a nation within a united Canada. It will work with the Government of QuÃ©bec to ensure our common prosperity. And our Government will continue to respect the division of jurisdiction at the heart of the Constitution adopted at Confederation.
41st,2nd,"Canada's Confederation is worth celebrating. As we approach our historic 150th anniversary in 2017, our Government will join with Canadians in honouring this momentous milestone by:"
41st,2nd,"The coming anniversary of Confederation is also a time to mark the contribution of Canada's First Nations, MÃ©tis and Inuit communities, who have had a defining role in shaping our country."
41st,2nd,The road to 2017 is a fitting time to strengthen our institutions and democratic processes.
41st,2nd,"Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the Commons, as the dawn of our Confederation approached in the 1860s, our founding Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald said of Canada's future that he saw ''a great nation - great in thought, great in action, great in hope, and great in position.''"
41st,2nd,His vision has come to pass.
41st,2nd,"Today, Canada is a model for the world. Admired for our freedom. Respected for our principles. Envied for our openness, compassion and peaceful pluralism."
41st,2nd,"As we approach the 150th anniversary of our great land, we look to the future. A future we will face true to our character, the character of a determined and enterprising people: Canadians, whose shops and small businesses spur the growth of our towns and cities; who work factory shifts and drive taxicabs to help their families get ahead; who take the same pride in raising their children as they do in being citizens of the best country on earth."
41st,2nd,"These are the quiet, unsung Canadians who are building our country."
41st,2nd,It is from them that we draw the inspiration to face an uncertain and unstable world.
41st,2nd,It is for them that we will seize the moment before us.
41st,2nd,"Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament."
41st,2nd,"Honourable Senators and Members of the House of Commons, you are the holders of a profound trust reposed in you by Canadians."
41st,2nd,May you be equal to that trust in all things and may Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
41st,2nd,Stay Connected
41st,1st,"3 June 2011 Ottawa, Ontario"
41st,1st,"I begin by congratulating all parliamentarians on this opening day of the Forty-first Parliament of Canada on my own behalf and on behalf of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, who sends her congratulations and warm good wishes. Many of you are returning to your duties as Members of the House of Commons, and over one hundred of you are about to take your places as elected representatives for the first time."
41st,1st,"Together, you have been entrusted with a profound responsibility: to serve the public interest on behalf of all Canadians."
41st,1st,"In the months since my installation as Governor General, I have had the privilege of meeting with Canadians in their communities, and at Rideau Hall and La Citadelle. It has been an honour to answer this unique call to service, and I want to share with you something of what I have learned in my travels across this remarkable country of ours."
41st,1st,"I have learned that, regardless of age or affiliation, all Canadians want to help create a better future for this country. Each of us aspires to a Canada where everyone can succeed and contribute, where excellence and opportunity coexist."
41st,1st,I have met with Canadians from all walks of life and discovered this common ground.
41st,1st,"In 2017, we will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation, and I invite all Canadians to imagine ways to build a smarter, more caring nation as we approach this wonderful milestone. I believe that in order to achieve our vision, we must work together to support families and children, to reinforce learning and innovation, and to encourage philanthropy and volunteerism."
41st,1st,"Each of us can answer the call to service in our own way and, together, continue this bold experiment that we call Canada."
41st,1st,"Canadians have expressed their desire for a strong, stable national government in this new Parliament. With this clear mandate, our Government will deliver on its commitments. It will implement the next phase of Canadaâs Economic Action Plan to build on the progress already made. It will continue to focus on jobs and growth. It will bring the federal budget back into balance. It will invest in our system of universal health care. It will support the communities and families that work so hard to care for each other. Our Government will defend the rights of law-abiding citizens, and it will promote Canadian values and interests at home and abroad."
41st,1st,"Our Government will be here for all Canadiansâfor individuals, for families and for all regions of the countryâas together we move Canada forward."
41st,1st,Jobs and growth will remain our Governmentâs top priority.
41st,1st,"Through Canadaâs Economic Action Plan, our Government took direct action to create jobs and protect Canadians during the global recession. On Monday, as our first order of business, our Government will reintroduce our Budget, in order to implement the next phase of Canadaâs Economic Action Planâour low tax plan for jobs and growth. We will get back to work on the things that matter most to Canadians: good jobs, security for our families and a prosperous future."
41st,1st,"Our Governmentâs plan builds on five years of hard work to create the right conditions for growth and job creation: a stable, predictable, low-tax environment; a highly skilled and flexible workforce; support for innovation and new technologies; and wider access to markets abroad. This approach has allowed Canada to meet the challenges of the global recession. The next phase of our Governmentâs plan is designed to help us stay on track during the recovery."
41st,1st,"Since 2006, Canadians have benefited from significant, broad-based tax cuts. These cuts have given families the flexibility to make the choices that are right for them. They have freed businesses to grow and succeed, creating the jobs on which Canadians depend. Our Government will continue on this path by introducing new tax credits for individuals and families, and by keeping taxes low to create jobs. It will also complete work already underway with the Government of Quebec to reach an agreement on tax harmonization no later than September 15, 2011."
41st,1st,"However, there is more to be done. The global economy remains fragile, and risks to our recovery persist. As well, Canadaâs workforce is aging, and it will no longer grow as it has in the past. This demographic challenge will impact our economic future and put long-term pressures on our pension and health systems that must be addressed."
41st,1st,"In the years ahead, our prosperity will also depend on making sure that all Canadians have the skills and opportunities to contribute, to innovate and to succeed. Our Governmentâs plan will provide assistance for workers who want to learn new skills and seize opportunities. It will remove barriers for older workers who want to continue their careers. It will lay the foundation for long-term growth by helping a new generation gain the critical skills they will need to thrive in the workforce."
41st,1st,"The success of Canadaâs job-creating businesses demands both hard work and good ideas, and we must create the right conditions for both to be rewarded. Our Government will introduce and seek swift passage of copyright legislation that balances the needs of creators and users."
41st,1st,"In order to improve Canadaâs productivity, enhance our economic competitiveness and increase our standard of living, our Government will continue to make targeted investments to promote and encourage research and development in Canada's private sector and in our universities, colleges and polytechnics. It will look for ways to support innovation while ensuring that federal investment in research and development is effective and maximizes results for Canadians. It will also release and implement a Digital Economy Strategy that enhances digital infrastructure and encourages Canadian businesses to adopt digital technologies and provide digital-skills training for their employees and new hires."
41st,1st,"In addition, our Government will continue to cut red tape for small businesses so that they can focus their attention on growing their businesses and creating jobs. This will be achieved while maintaining the highest standards to protect our environment and the health and safety of Canadians."
41st,1st,"Our Government will also continue opening new markets for Canadian businesses in order to create good new jobs for Canadian workers. Since 2006, we have signed free trade agreements covering eight countries, and negotiations covering some fifty more are underway."
41st,1st,"Our Government will aim to complete negotiations on a free trade agreement with the European Union by 2012. It will also seek to complete negotiations on a free trade agreement with India in 2013. In all international forums and bilateral negotiations, our Government will continue to stand up for Canadian farmers and industries by defending supply management."
41st,1st,"The United States is our most important trading partner, ally and friend. Our Government will work with President Obama and his administration to deliver on the Shared Vision for Perimeter Security and Economic Competitiveness. We will strengthen our collaboration to streamline and secure our border and enhance regulatory cooperation, ensuring that people and goods can flow freely and safely between our two countries."
41st,1st,Our Government also understands the importance of attracting foreign investment to our economy. Foreign investment helps Canadian companies grow by introducing new technologies and practicesâlaunching pads to strengthen growth and innovation here at home. It provides new opportunities to connect our firms to the world. Our Government will continue to welcome foreign investment that benefits Canada.
41st,1st,"Our Government will also move forward with willing partners to establish a new national securities regulator, subject to the Supreme Courtâs decision on the extent of federal jurisdiction."
41st,1st,"Nearly three years ago, the world faced an unprecedented financial crisis. Drawing on strong fundamentals and the values of the hard-working Canadians and firms that refused to let difficult times define them, our Economic Action Plan helped Canada emerge quickly from recession. Working closely with provinces, territories and communities, our Government moved swiftly to deliver a targeted, time-limited stimulus program that created and protected jobs right across the country."
41st,1st,"Hard work, determination and responsible choices allowed us to make these extraordinary investments when times were tough, while avoiding the high debt levels that threaten other countries. We must now take that same approach to future growth. We must eliminate the deficit and return to balanced budgets to ensure that our economy can continue to grow and create jobs and that the federal government will have sufficient fiscal flexibility for future choices."
41st,1st,"Our Government had committed to achieving this by 2015. In order to accelerate the return to a balanced budget and to eliminate the deficit one year earlier, over the next year we will undertake a Strategic and Operating Review of government spending led by a new Cabinet subcommittee established for this purpose. This review will be focused on reducing the cost of government, while keeping taxes low and preserving transfers to individuals and provinces for essential things like pensions, health and education. Our Government will also complete its stimulus package as promised and continue specific measures to restrain the growth of government expenditures."
41st,1st,"Our Governmentâs plan will put us on a strong footing to resume paying down the federal debt, further reduce taxes on families and continue investing in priorities."
41st,1st,"There is no greater priority for Canadians than caring for their loved ones. Canadians believe that their parents and grandparents have worked hard and deserve a secure retirement. They want their children and grandchildren to grow up with every opportunity to lead happy, healthy lives."
41st,1st,"Many Canadian families struggle to realize these goals. That is why our Governmentâs low-tax plan will permanently enhance the Guaranteed Income Supplement for some 680,000 of Canadaâs most vulnerable seniors. This increaseâthe largest in a quarter centuryâwill help these seniors make ends meet. At the same time, our Government will continue to help Canadians save for their retirement, and will work with provincial and territorial partners to implement the Pooled Registered Pension Plan."
41st,1st,"Our Governmentâs plan also recognizes the tremendous time and resources required of family caregivers. Many individuals and families have added responsibilities in caring for infirm parents or relatives. These family caregivers make special sacrifices, often leaving the workforce temporarily and forgoing employment income."
41st,1st,"The new Family Caregiver Tax Credit will support those who care for a dependent family member who is infirm. In addition, our Government will remove the cap on eligible expenses that caregivers can claim under the Medical Expense Tax Credit."
41st,1st,Our Government will also support parents in providing their children with opportunities to grow personally and discover their creative passions by establishing a Childrenâs Arts Tax Credit.
41st,1st,"Canadians want and expect their health care system to be there when they and their families need it most. Canadians want better results from the health care system, at the same time as an aging population is putting unprecedented pressure on the systemâs ability to deliver."
41st,1st,"Our Government is committed to respecting provincial jurisdiction and working with the provinces and territories to ensure that the health care system is sustainable and that there is accountability for results. It will maintain the six percent escalator for the Canada Health Transfer, while working collaboratively with provincial partners to renew the Health Accord and to continue reducing wait times. As has been done before, our Government will enter into a separate agreement with the Government of Quebec regarding the implementation of the renewed Health Accord."
41st,1st,"Canadians are united by core values, a shared history and a sense of common purpose. Our Government will join Canadians in celebrating our heritage, in promoting our values and in standing for what is right on the world stage. In an uncertain global environment, our Government will also continue to pursue a stable, principled foreign policy that advances Canadaâs interests."
41st,1st,"The Canadian Armed Forces play a crucial role in defending our sovereignty and national security. As the Canadian mission in Afghanistan transitions to training, diplomacy and development, our Government joins Canadians in honouring those who gave their lives and in recognizing the sacrifice and achievements of all the men and women, both military and civilian, who have served and continue to serve in Afghanistan. Our Government will continue to recognize and support all veterans."
41st,1st,"Today, as North Africa and the Middle East are being transformed by their people, the Canadian Armed Forces are standing tall with our allies to protect civilians in Libya. Our Government will hold a parliamentary debate on the future of this important mission."
41st,1st,"As part of our ongoing efforts to promote human rights, our Government will create a new Office of Religious Freedom to help protect religious minorities and to promote the pluralism that is essential to the development of free and democratic societies."
41st,1st,"We will also take action to strengthen our national sovereignty. Our Government is committed to protecting the integrity of our immigration system. It will introduce measures to address marriage fraudâan abuse of our system that can victimize unsuspecting Canadians and vulnerable immigrants. Our Government will also reintroduce legislation to combat human smuggling, which can place migrants in dangerous conditions and undermine trust in Canadaâs immigration system."
41st,1st,"Our Government has made Canadaâs North a cornerstone of its agenda. The strongest expression of our sovereignty comes through presence and actions, not words. Our Government will continue to exercise leadership in the stewardship of northern lands and waters. It is also committed to working with the Northwest Territories and the private sector to complete the Dempster Highwayâby linking Inuvik to Tuktoyaktukâthereby realizing Prime Minister Diefenbakerâs vision of connecting Canada by road from sea to sea to sea."
41st,1st,"Canadaâs natural environment shapes our national identity, our health and our prosperity. Our Government has expanded protected lands and marine areas to an unprecedented extent, so that current and future generations can continue to enjoy them. In this, the 100th anniversary year of our national parks system, our Government will create significant new protected areas. It will work with provincial, regional, municipal, Aboriginal and community stakeholders toward establishing an urban national park in the Rouge Valley of eastern Toronto. Looking to the future, our Government will engage a broad range of stakeholders on the development of a National Conservation Plan, to move our conservation objectives forward and better connect all Canadians with nature."
41st,1st,"Our Government is committed to developing Canadaâs extraordinary resource wealth in a way that protects the environment. It will support major new clean energy projects of national or regional significance, such as the planned Lower Churchill hydroelectricity project in Atlantic Canada. It will engage the provinces, territories and industry on ways to improve the regulatory and environmental assessment process for resource projects, while ensuring meaningful consultation with affected communities, including Aboriginal communities."
41st,1st,"Beyond our natural heritage, Canadians also cherish our shared history. Anniversaries are an important part of how a society marks its collective progress and defines its goals for the future. A key milestone next year will be the bicentennial of the War of 1812. We will remember how those of diverse backgrounds and various regions came together to fight for Canada, ensuring the independent destiny of our country in North America. We will also celebrate the 200th anniversary of the Selkirk Settlement, which marks the founding of Manitoba and the early days of the modern West."
41st,1st,"Next year we will observe Her Majestyâs Diamond Jubilee, celebrating her six decades of service as Queen of Canada. And Canadians look forward, in just a few weeksâ time, to welcoming Their Royal Highnesses The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on their first Royal Tour since their marriage this spring."
41st,1st,The Government of Canada has no more fundamental duty than to protect the personal safety of our citizens and defend against threats to our national security.
41st,1st,"Our Government will move quickly to reintroduce comprehensive law-and-order legislation to combat crime and terrorism. These measures will protect children from sex offenders. They will eliminate house arrest and pardons for serious crimes. They will give law enforcement officials, courts and victims the legal tools they need to fight criminals and terrorists. Our Government will continue to protect the most vulnerable in society and work to prevent crime. It will propose tougher sentences for those who abuse seniors and will help at risk youth avoid gangs and criminal activity. It will address the problem of violence against women and girls."
41st,1st,"Our Government has always believed the interests of law-abiding citizens should be placed ahead of those of criminals. Canadians who are victimized or threatened by crime deserve their governmentâs support and protection, and they should have the right to take reasonable steps to defend themselves and their property when the police cannot be there to assist them. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to clarify and strengthen laws on self-defence, defence of property and citizenâs arrest."
41st,1st,Our Government will also continue to implement its response to the Air India Report.
41st,1st,"In addition to guarding the interests of our nation as a whole, our Government will continue taking action to address the needs and aspirations of every region of the country. Local communities are best placed to overcome their unique challenges, but government can help create the conditions for these communitiesâand the industries that sustain themâto succeed."
41st,1st,"Canadaâs rural communities are rich in history and culture, and generations of rural Canadians have worked hard and played by the rules. They should not be the target of unfair laws. Our Government will act on its promise to introduce legislation to end the wasteful and ineffective long-gun registry."
41st,1st,"Canadaâs traditional industries remain crucial to our economy. Our Government has always stood behind Canadaâs agricultural, forestry, fishing, mineral, manufacturing and energy sectorsâand will continue to support them as they innovate and grow. It will also introduce legislation to ensure that western farmers have the freedom to sell wheat and barley on the open market."
41st,1st,"Canadaâs Aboriginal peoples are central to Canadaâs history, and our Government has made it a priority to renew and deepen our relationship. The contribution of Canadaâs Aboriginal peoples will be important to our future prosperity. Concerted action is needed to address the barriers to social and economic participation that many Aboriginal Canadians face."
41st,1st,"Our Government will work with Aboriginal communities, provinces and territories to meet this challenge. It will help open the door to greater economic development by providing new investments in First Nations Land Management. It will promote access to clean water and the deployment of clean energy technology in Aboriginal and northern communities."
41st,1st,"Building on the work of the National Panel on First Nation Elementary and Secondary Education, our Government will engage with partners to make concrete, positive changes to give First Nations children a better education so that they can realize their dreams. We will also expand adult basic education programming in the territories to help to increase education and employment levels."
41st,1st,Our Government will also introduce legislation to ensure that people living on reserve have the same matrimonial real property rights and protections as other Canadians.
41st,1st,"Canadaâs diverse communities are connected by shared values and aspirations, and by the willingness to lend a hand. This has been markedly evident in the response of ordinary Canadians to recent and devastating floods and wildfires. Our Government recognizes the resolve and courage shown by Canadian communities in the face of adversity and will stand by them in their times of need."
41st,1st,"In these and all other measures our Government will pursue, we will provide the principled, accountable leadership and good, clean government that Canadians deserve. On first taking office, our Government introduced major new accountability legislation as its first act in the Thirty-ninth Parliament, and it will now move forward on its long-standing commitment to democratic reform."
41st,1st,Reform of the Senate remains a priority for our Government. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to limit term lengths and to encourage provinces and territories to hold elections for Senate nominees.
41st,1st,Canadians rightly expect fairness and accountability in the full range of government institutions that serve them. Our Government will reintroduce legislation to restore fair representation in the House of Commons. It will take steps to phase out direct taxpayer subsidies to federal political parties over the next three years. It will support transparency for First Nations communities by requiring their chiefs and councillors to publish their salaries and expenses. Our Government will also support the efforts of the Public Service to modernize the way it works so that it can continue to provide the highest standard of service to Canadians.
41st,1st,"In filling the two upcoming vacancies on the Supreme Court of Canada, our Government will engage parliamentarians through the transparent process first used in 2006."
41st,1st,"Our Government will also ensure that citizens, the private sector and other partners have improved access to the workings of government through open data, open information and open dialogue."
41st,1st,"As Canadians, we take pride in our history and look forward to our future as the true North, strong and free. From our earliest days, we have always come together to advance our common purpose, each of us ready to do our part to move Canada forward."
41st,1st,"Building on the careful investments and decisive actions of the past five years, our Government will move swiftly to deliver the next important phase of the Economic Action Plan. Our Government will reflect the courage Canadians show in meeting the challenges of today and their determination to rise to those they see on the horizon."
41st,1st,"Members of the House of Commons, you will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament."
41st,1st,"Honourable Senators and Members of the House of Commons, let the work of our great democracy support Canadians as they go about fashioning a twenty-first century destiny limited only by their ambition and imagination."
41st,1st,May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations and make you equal to the trust bestowed upon you.
41st,1st,Stay Connected
40th,3rd,"March 3, 2010 Ottawa, Ontario"
40th,3rd,"We are a country whose citizens do not turn back when confronted by obstacles, whatever they are, and never shrink from lending a helping hand to the most disadvantaged, wherever they may be."
40th,3rd,"Though the effects of the global recession have not fully faded, Canadians are demonstrating a spirit of generosity that is a harbinger of hope to the people of Haiti, the poorest country in the Americas, which has been shaken by a disaster of unprecedented scope."
40th,3rd,"The world we live in remains strong because of the ties of solidarity that we â women, men and young people â forge among ourselves and because of the care we show toward one another."
40th,3rd,"As the Vancouver Winter Olympics and upcoming Paralympics remind us, there are also circumstances when festive hearts and the sharing of a common humanity are our greatest hope."
40th,3rd,"I know Canadians will continue to care, and that spirit of solidarity will redefine their sense of sharing as efforts are made to support the economic recovery."
40th,3rd,We gather for a new session of Parliament at a time of both great uncertainty and great optimism. Uncertainty because Canadians still feel the lingering effects of a recession that was not of their making. Optimism because our country has weathered the storm better than most and because Canadians over the past year have shown the world as never before both our capacity to care and our capability to act.
40th,3rd,"The agenda our Government laid before Parliament just over one year ago is largely in place. Through Canada's Economic Action Plan, our Government took decisive steps to protect incomes, create jobs, ease credit markets, and help workers and communities get back on their feet. As we begin to see modest improvements in growth and employment, the task before us today is to finish the work begun last year."
40th,3rd,"Jobs and growth remain the top priority. Our Government will complete the second year of Canada's Economic Action Plan â guided by extensive consultations with leaders in business, industry, and everyday working people and their families â and make refinements where necessary."
40th,3rd,"At the same time, Canada is poised to emerge from the recession powered by one of the strongest economies in the industrialized world. Therefore, our attention must also encompass the new measures Canada needs for success in the modern economy."
40th,3rd,"This will require a return to fiscal balance, securing the strong budgetary position that distinguishes our country from so many others."
40th,3rd,"While the task before us is great, the ingenuity, determination and compassion of Canadians are greater. We will ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world to raise a family. We will continue to stand up for those who built this great country. And we will forge ahead in building a Canada that is strong and united in a changing world."
40th,3rd,"Canadians have confronted the challenges of the past year in the same way they have always met adversity â with pragmatism, resourcefulness and the spirit of partnership."
40th,3rd,"From the forest floor to the factory floor, Canadians have rallied in the face of the global recession. Businesses have found new ways to adapt to tighter credit and weaker markets. Workers have shared their jobs to spare colleagues from layoff. Many Canadians, out of work for the first time in their lives, have begun training for a new career. And households across the country have adjusted their finances to account for new realities."
40th,3rd,"Like Canadians themselves, governments across the country have adapted their approaches and joined together in a concerted effort to soften the impact of the recession."
40th,3rd,Canada's Economic Action Plan is working. Tax cuts and enhanced Employment Insurance benefits are providing direct support to Canadians who paid into government programs over the years and now need help.
40th,3rd,"From coast to coast to coast, almost 16,000 projects are putting Canadians to work while laying the foundation for future prosperity. These projects range from roads and bridges to colleges and universities, from social housing to our cultural and heritage institutions."
40th,3rd,"Communities and industries most affected by the downturn are being supported. Businesses have begun hiring again, with the economy adding more than 135,000 net new jobs since July 2009. This has restored incomes, confidence and hope for the future for families across the country."
40th,3rd,"But even as confidence returns to our economy, it would be a mistake to declare that the recession is completely behind us. Too many Canadians still find themselves out of work and events beyond our borders could yet threaten a fragile recovery."
40th,3rd,"Our Government's top priority is therefore to complete the second year of Canada's Economic Action Plan and to continue creating jobs and growth. Our Government will work with its partners in the provinces and territories to make certain that projects are completed now and over the coming year, when the stimulus is most needed."
40th,3rd,"Our Government understands the real hardships experienced by Canadian families affected by job loss. Recognizing that unemployment continues to cast a long shadow over the recovery, our Government will continue to work on job creation and job protection. And it will help young Canadians looking to enter today's tough job market for the first time to make the transition to work."
40th,3rd,"Canadians understand that the events of the past year have required governments everywhere to run budgetary deficits. They also know that because our Government made the responsible choice to pay down debt in good economic times, Canada's debt levels remain by far the smallest in the G7. And they appreciate that this has allowed our country to enact one of the largest stimulus programs in the world without unduly burdening future generations."
40th,3rd,"At the same time, Canadians live within their means and expect their governments to do the same. Spending designed for a rainy day should not become an all-weather practice."
40th,3rd,"Canadians also realize that a balanced budget is not an end in itself, but the foundation of a strong and resilient economy. In taking responsible steps to reduce the deficit, our Government will not repeat the mistakes of the past."
40th,3rd,Balancing the nation's books will not come at the expense of pensioners. It will not come by cutting transfer payments for health care and education or by raising taxes on hard-working Canadians. These are simply excuses for a federal government to avoid controlling spending.
40th,3rd,"Our Government's first step toward restoring fiscal balance will be to wind down stimulus spending as economic activity rebounds. It will work with its provincial, territorial and municipal partners to ensure that measures under Canada's Economic Action Plan come to an end by March 31, 2011. And as chair of the G8 and G20 this year, our Government will lead the call for a globally coordinated approach to the withdrawal of economic stimulus."
40th,3rd,"The second step toward restoring fiscal balance will be to restrain federal program spending overall, while protecting growth in transfers that directly benefit Canadians, such as pensions, health care and education."
40th,3rd,"Industry and ingenuity have been the hallmarks of Canada's economy since the beginning. Aboriginal peoples, voyageurs and pioneers established the backbone of our modern trading nation. Immigrants armed only with dreams and determination travelled west to open the land that would become our breadbasket. Bright minds with bold ideas transformed sound and electricity into the communications network that links our world."
40th,3rd,"But today we face new challenges. Determined new competitors are rising. The relentless pace of technology means that every day there is something newer, faster, better. To succeed in the global economy, Canada must keep step as the world races forward."
40th,3rd,"Our strategy is clear: we must combine the best of our intellectual and natural resources to create jobs, growth and opportunity."
40th,3rd,"Canada's strategy for economic success must leverage our considerable strengths, in particular our world-leading financial industry and energy resource endowment."
40th,3rd,"Finally, our strategy for the economy must create the conditions for continued success in the industries that are the foundation for Canada's prosperity and support thousands of communities, both rural and urban."
40th,3rd,"Regardless of profession or trade, of industry or region, Canadians have always striven toward a common objective â to make a home and nurture a family. For many Canadians, there can be no greater accomplishment than to provide for their children, to contribute to the local community, and to live in a safe and secure country. Our Government shares and supports these aspirations."
40th,3rd,"To help Canadian families to balance work and family life, our Government introduced the Universal Child Care Benefit to provide $100 per month for each child under the age of six. This is direct financial support to working families that gives them the freedom to choose the best child care for them. Our Government will strengthen this benefit for sole-support, single-parent families."
40th,3rd,"Protecting the health and safety of Canadians and their families is a priority of our Government. This commitment was reflected in its decision to secure the H1N1 vaccine for every Canadian. To assure parents that their children's food, medicine and toys are safe, our Government will reintroduce legislation to protect Canadian families from unsafe food, drug and consumer products. Our Government will respect the wishes of Canadians by reintroducing the consumer product safety legislation in its original form."
40th,3rd,Our Government will continue to strengthen Canada's food safety system.
40th,3rd,"It will ensure that families have the information they need to make informed choices and it will hold those who produce, import and sell goods in Canada accountable for the safety of Canadians."
40th,3rd,"To prevent accidents that harm our children and youth, our Government will also work in partnership with non-governmental organizations to launch a national strategy on childhood injury prevention."
40th,3rd,"Just as we know that parents are in the best position to make decisions for their families, the best solutions to the diverse challenges confronting Canada's communities are often found locally. Every day, the power of innovation is seen at work in communities across this country, as citizens, businesses and charitable groups join forces to tackle local problems."
40th,3rd,"Too often, however, grassroots efforts are hobbled by red tape. Too often, local solutions are denied access to government assistance because they do not fit the bureaucratic definition of the problem. Too often, the efforts of communities falter not on account of a lack of effort or heart, but because of a lack of expertise to turn good ideas into reality."
40th,3rd,"Our communities are built on the rule of law, the cornerstone of peace, order and good government. The law must protect everyone, and those who commit crimes must be held to account. Canadians want a justice system that delivers justice. We know we can protect ourselves without compromising the values that define our country."
40th,3rd,"Our Government acted decisively to crack down on crime and ensure the safety and security of our neighbourhoods and communities. It introduced laws mandating prison sentences for gun crimes, toughening sentencing for dangerous criminals, raising to 16 from 14 the age of protection from adult sexual predators, and ensuring that criminals serve sentences that reflect the severity of their crimes."
40th,3rd,"Our Government will now focus on the further protection of children, women and victims of white-collar crime."
40th,3rd,"Justice must be effective, swift and true. It must also be fair to victims of crime."
40th,3rd,"Just as criminals threaten Canadians' personal safety, terrorists threaten our country's security. Our peaceful, prosperous and pluralistic society is one of the safest places in the world to live. Yet Canada faces real, significant and shifting threats. Our Government will take steps to safeguard Canada's national security."
40th,3rd,"Canadians believe sacrifice and hard work should be recognized. As we strive to create an even better future for our families and communities, our Government will stand up for those who built and defended this country."
40th,3rd,"Superior health care and quality of life mean that Canadians now enjoy one of the longest life expectancies in the world. As more and more Canadians enter their golden years, our Government will seek to enhance their well-being during the retirement that they have earned. This demographic shift poses a challenge to the sustainability of our social programs and our economy. Our Government will meet the demands of the aging population."
40th,3rd,"Our Government has taken numerous measures to assure our senior citizens that Canada's retirement income system is the strongest in the world. Among other measures, our Government has introduced Tax Free Savings Accounts and income splitting for Canada's pensioners."
40th,3rd,"Just as generations of Canadians worked on the home front to build this great country, so too have generations of veterans fought to defend Canada and Canadian values around the world. We are reminded of the bravery and sacrifice of those who serve in our Armed Forces as we celebrate this year's centenary of the Royal Canadian Navy and as we mark the passing of John Henry Foster Babcock, the last surviving Canadian veteran of World War I. A national day of commemoration will be held on Vimy Ridge Day, April 9, to celebrate the contribution his generation made to the cause of freedom."
40th,3rd,"Today, however, a new generation of men and women in uniform continues to stand up for the values and principles Canadians hold dear. In Afghanistan, the Canadian Forces prepare for the end of the military mission in 2011 with the knowledge that â through great sacrifice and with great distinction â their efforts saved Kandahar province from falling back under Taliban control. After 2011, our effort in Afghanistan will focus on development and humanitarian aid."
40th,3rd,"In Haiti, the Canadian Forces have taken the lessons learned in Afghanistan and put them to use in very different circumstances. Their speed and effectiveness in deployment were and are unsurpassed in the world."
40th,3rd,"To serve Canada in the profession of arms is an extraordinary and honourable acceptance of risks, many of which cannot be foreseen, and all of which may have profound personal consequences for those who assume them. Our Government has supported our men and women in uniform not only in words, but by making the investments necessary to rebuild Canada's military. Our Government will continue to stand up for our military and our veterans."
40th,3rd,"Honouring those who built this country includes recognizing the contribution of those who make their living on the land and the realities of rural life in Canada. Our Government will continue to support legislation to repeal the wasteful and ineffective long-gun registry that targets law-abiding farmers and hunters, not criminals."
40th,3rd,"Our Government also recognizes the contributions of Canada's Aboriginal people. Too often, their stories have been ones of sorrow. Our Government will continue to build on its historic apology for the treatment of children in residential schools."
40th,3rd,"Our values as Canadians are rooted in our history and in our institutions. Our parliamentary democracy, which brought together people of many lands, faiths and languages to live in harmony. Our federal system, which recognizes our differences, while advancing our unity. Our official languages. Our northern landscape."
40th,3rd,"We are a country whose story is still being written. Last month, Canadians took pride in the inspired performances of our Olympic athletes at the Winter Games in Vancouver and cheered when Alexandre Bilodeau won our first-ever Olympic gold medal on our own soil. But our athletes did not stop at just one. They surpassed the record for the most gold medals ever won at a Winter Olympics. We are proud of our medallists and the entire Canadian Olympic team. Next week, the Paralympic Games will officially begin and again we will cheer as our athletes take on the world. Our Government will continue to invest in world-class Canadian athletics."
40th,3rd,"A shared understanding of Canadian history unites us as citizens. Two years ago, we celebrated the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City. This year we mark the quadricentenary of the settling of Cupids, Newfoundland and Labrador. Two years hence, our Government will engage millions of citizens and strengthen knowledge and pride in Canada by commemorating the bicentennial of the War of 1812, an event that was key to shaping our identity as Canadians and ultimately our existence as a country. That year Canadians will also celebrate the 60th anniversary of the accession of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada, and our Government has established a Diamond Jubilee Committee to prepare for this historic occasion. Our Government will also ask Parliament to examine the original gender-neutral English wording of the national anthem."
40th,3rd,"We are a country founded on democracy. Our shared values and experiences must be reflected in our national institutions, starting with Parliament. To reflect the growing number of Canadians living in Ontario, British Columbia and Alberta, our Government will follow through on its commitment to address their under-representation, consistent with the fundamental, democratic, constitutional principle of representation by population in the House of Commons. It will propose legislation to increase voter participation by expanding advance voting in elections. Our Government also remains committed to Senate reform and will continue to pursue measures to make the upper chamber more democratic, effective and accountable."
40th,3rd,Our Government recognizes the Public Service of Canada as a critical national institution. Our Government will continue to support the renewal of the Public Service and ensure it is ready for the changes required by the aging of its own and the wider Canadian labour force.
40th,3rd,"We are a bilingual country. Canada's two official languages are an integral part of our history and position us uniquely in the world. Building on the recognition that the QuÃ©bÃ©cois form a nation within a united Canada, and the Roadmap for Canada's Linguistic Duality, our Government will take steps to strengthen further Canada's francophone identity. It will also continue to respect provincial jurisdiction and to restrict the use of the federal spending power."
40th,3rd,We are a country with an Aboriginal heritage. A growing number of states have given qualified recognition to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Our Government will take steps to endorse this aspirational document in a manner fully consistent with Canada's Constitution and laws.
40th,3rd,"We are a country of immigrants. Our identities are bound up in the stories of ancestors from hundreds of lands. To share these stories, our Government will introduce legislation to establish Pier 21 in Halifax â the site where so many began their Canadian journey â as Canada's National Museum of Immigration. It will continue to work with the provinces to strengthen recognition of foreign credentials through the Pan-Canadian Framework for the Assessment and Recognition of Foreign Qualifications. To better protect would-be immigrants, our Government will take steps to shut down unscrupulous immigration consultants. Our Government will also introduce legislation to speed up the revocation of citizenship of those who have concealed their war crimes."
40th,3rd,"We are a country of refuge. For those victimized by disaster in their homeland or facing persecution by their own governments, Canada is a beacon. When disaster struck in Haiti, our Government accelerated the adoption process for Haitian orphans. And it is allowing Haitians temporarily in Canada to extend their stays. To remove the years of uncertainty often faced by refugees in genuine need, while closing off avenues for those simply seeking a back door into the country, our Government will propose comprehensive reforms to the refugee system. It supports the establishment of a National Monument to the Victims of Communism and it will support legislation to establish a national Holocaust memorial."
40th,3rd,We are a northern country. Canadians are deeply influenced by the vast expanse of our Arctic and its history and legends. Our Government established the Northern Strategy to realize the potential of Canada's North for northerners and all Canadians.
40th,3rd,"We are a country of unparalleled natural beauty. To further protect and preserve the diversity and health of our natural environment, our Government will bolster its Action Plan on Clean Water. And it will build on the creation of more than 85,000 square kilometres of national parks and marine conservation areas as part of its national conservation plan."
40th,3rd,"We are a country that stands up for what is right in the world. Canadians want their Government to do what is right, not what is popular. They want their country to carry its share of the work in international affairs, not just talk about it. And they want their Government to make only those commitments it intends to keep."
40th,3rd,"In the debate among nations, our Government will pursue a foreign policy that responds to changing times but remains anchored in Canadian values and an enlightened view of sovereignty that recognizes that national interests are often interconnected."
40th,3rd,"Nowhere is a commitment to principled policy, backed by action, needed more than in addressing climate change. Our Government has advocated for an agreement that includes all the world's major greenhouse gas emitters, for that is the only way to actually reduce global emissions. And it has pursued a balanced approach to emissions reduction that recognizes the importance of greening the economy for tomorrow and protecting jobs today."
40th,3rd,"The Copenhagen Accord reflects these principles and is fully supported by the Government of Canada. Together with other industrialized countries, Canada will provide funding to help developing economies reduce their emissions and adapt to climate change. Here at home, our Government will continue to take steps to fight climate change by leading the world in clean electricity generation. And recognizing our integrated continental economic links, our Government will work to reduce emissions through the Canada-U.S. clean energy dialogue launched last year with President Obama's administration."
40th,3rd,"Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the Commons, you are charged with a most important task â to give voice to the values, concerns and aspirations of Canadians."
40th,3rd,This is a year when the eyes of the world are on Canada.
40th,3rd,A year in which our athletes are excelling here at home at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.
40th,3rd,"A year in which Canada will host world leaders at the North American, G8 and G20 summits."
40th,3rd,A year in which Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II will celebrate Canada Day with Canadians.
40th,3rd,"A year in which Canadians are leading the way in humanitarian efforts in Haiti, just as they are standing for freedom â at great cost â in Afghanistan."
40th,3rd,And it is a year during which the Canadian economy is emerging from recession as one of the strongest and most resilient in the developed world.
40th,3rd,These are all things of which Canadians can be justifiably proud.
40th,3rd,"They remind every Canadian that our citizenship is more than a contract to pay taxes in exchange for government services. To be Canadian is to show the world that people drawn from every nation can live in harmony. To seek peace, but stand on guard for rights, democracy and the rule of law. To be resolute in confronting a global crisis and ambitious in planning for a more prosperous future."
40th,3rd,"The future to which Canadians aspire will not arrive by chance. Grand visions for a nation's future will come to nothing if not balanced by the means to pay for them. To realize the hopes Canadians hold for themselves and their families, the economy must remain our Government's single most urgent priority. Hope is borne on the wings of prosperity."
40th,3rd,That is why tomorrow our Government will present a budget focused on jobs and growth â now and for the future.
40th,3rd,"Honourable Members, let us join together to build a stronger Canada and a stronger economy."
40th,3rd,"As you set about this vital work, I pray that Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."

40th,2nd,Â 
40th,2nd,"Honourable Senators, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and gentlemen, In these uncertain times, when the world is threatened by a struggling economy, it is imperative that we work together, that we stand beside one another and that we strive for greater solidarity. Today, in our democratic tradition, Canadians expect that their elected representatives will dedicate their efforts to ensure that Canada emerges stronger from this serious economic crisis. Once again, the peopleï¿½s representatives have gathered to consider the priorities of another parliamentary session. Each Throne Speech is a milestone on the remarkable 142-year Canadian journey. Your predecessors, too, were summoned to this chamber at times of great crisis: as Canada struggled to claim her independence, in the shadow of war, during the depth of the Great Depression and at moments when great policy division tugged the very bonds of this union. Today we meet at a time of unprecedented economic uncertainty. The global credit crunch has dragged the world economy into a crisis whose pull we cannot escape. The nations of the world are grappling with challenges that Canada can address but not avoid.  The Governmentï¿½s agenda and the priorities of Parliament must adapt in response to the deepening crisis. Old assumptions must be tested and old decisions must be rethought. The global economy has weakened since Canadians voted in the last general election. In fact, it has weakened further since Parliament met last month.  Our Government has listened to Canadians who are concerned about how the worldwide recession is affecting their jobs, their savings and their communities. Our Government has reached out to Canadians in all regions, in all communities and from all walks of life.Â  Our Government has consulted widely:"
40th,2nd,Â 
40th,2nd,"Our Government approached the dialogue in a spirit of open and non-partisan cooperation. There is no monopoly on good ideas because we face this crisis together. There can be no pride of authorshipï¿½only the satisfaction of identifying solutions that will work for all Canadians.Â   Acting on the constructive thoughts and suggestions that have been received, our Government will tomorrow present Canada ï¿½s economic stimulus plan. The plan will protect our economy from immediate threat, while making investments to promote long term growth. The economic stimulus plan will be a plan of action."
40th,2nd,Â 
40th,2nd,"These actions will be targeted, they will inject immediate stimulus while promoting long-term growth and they will avoid a return to permanent deficits. These actions will protect the jobs of today while readying our economy to create the jobs of tomorrow. Canadians face a difficult year?perhaps several difficult years. In the face of such uncertainty, our Government has developed a clear and focused plan. Our Government will spend what is necessary to stimulate the economy, and invest what is necessary to protect our future prosperity. As Canadians expect, the economy will be the focus of our Government's actions and of the measures placed before Parliament during the coming year. In pursuing measures to support the economy, our Government will also attend to the other important priorities that it set out in the Speech from the Throne to open the 40th Parliament. The present crisis is new, but the imperative of concerted action is a challenge to which Parliament has risen many times in our history. What will sustain us today will be the same strengths of character that have pulled Canada through critical times before: unity, determination and constancy of purpose. Honourable Members of the Senate,  Members of the House of Commons: As you unite in common effort and in common cause, may Divine Providence be your guide and inspiration."

40th,1st,"Two hundred and fifty years ago, on October 2, 1758, the first parliamentary assembly of its kind in Canada was held in Nova Scotia . It is worth solemnly remembering in this Chamber the historic significance of that event."
40th,1st,"Because today, we are free to reach our full potential thanks to the efforts of women and men, young and old, who established democracy in this country, where anything is possible."
40th,1st,"This country is made up of every hope we cherish, every dream we pursue, every project we realize."
40th,1st,Upholding the ideal of democracy that we embody in the world is a responsibility that each of us bears.
40th,1st,"As the great-great-granddaughter of slaves, born under one of the most brutal dictatorships in history, I know just how precious this legacy is to the citizens of this country. They have again and again expressed their pride in this legacy to me, through their words and deeds, over the past three years."
40th,1st,"In these uncertain economic times, it is more important than ever that our spirit of solidarity prevails and reaches beyond our borders, so that Canada represents not only a hope of renewal, but also a promise for the future."
40th,1st,"Today, in this democratic tradition, the representatives of the Canadian people gather for the 40th time in this great nation's history to open a new federal Parliament."
40th,1st,"For over 140 years, since the era of Queen Victoria, Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir George-Etienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation, the Parliament of Canada has assembled to deliberate upon the great issues of the day."
40th,1st,"This institution thus represents one of the longest and most unblemished records of peaceful, democratic self-government anywhere on Earth."
40th,1st,"The people spoke once again in a general election on October 14th, and entrusted this Government with a renewed and strengthened mandate."
40th,1st,"At the same time, the people also chose to elect a minority Parliament. And in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, the government must always be responsible and accountable to the people's representatives."
40th,1st,Our Government is mindful of both the privilege and the responsibility with which we have been entrusted.
40th,1st,This is a time of extraordinary global economic challenge and uncertainty. The world's financial system faces pressures not seen for many generations. Governments around the world have taken unprecedented steps to restore confidence in the face of a global economic slowdown.
40th,1st,"As Canadians watch these developments unfold, they rightly wonder about what they might mean here at home, for their jobs, their savings and their families' well-being. Canadians know that, as Canada is a trading nation in the global economy, these eventsâwhile originating outside our bordersâwill nevertheless reverberate here."
40th,1st,"In the face of this uncertainty, just as when faced with difficulties before, Canadians will prevail."
40th,1st,"Canada was founded on the belief that, by joining our strength in confederation, our united country would be able to meet and rise above any challenge set before us."
40th,1st,"From the explorers and pioneers to the settlers and railroad builders, this vast country was built by people who took tremendous risks and braved unforgiving elements for the prospect of a better future."
40th,1st,"The dawn of a new century saw new challenges. In a war that ended ninety years ago last week, our young country came of age on battlefields whose names echo across our historyâYpres, Vimy, Passchendaele. The generation that followed overcame the Depression and again confronted the devastation of war. The achievements of these generations are marked not only by monuments to their bravery and sacrifices, but also by their legacy in forging Canada as one of the most peaceful and prosperous nations on Earth."
40th,1st,"We know that Canadians will face the problems of today with the same spirit of determination and resolve as those who came before us faced the challenges of their generation. And like them, we know that we will emerge stronger than ever."
40th,1st,"In this time of global economic instability, we can be reassured that the hard work of millions of Canadians has laid a solid foundation for our country. We have pursued policies different from those of many of our trading partners. We have paid down debt and kept spending under control. We have set public pensions on a sound footing and refinanced important programs such as health care and post-secondary education. Our banks are among the strongest and best regulated in the world. Canadian households and businesses have been prudent and avoided taking on the excessive debt witnessed elsewhere."
40th,1st,"Embarking on its renewed mandate, our Government is committed to providing the strong leadership that Canadians expect. It will protect Canadians in difficult times. It will work with Canadians to secure our future prosperity. It will support Canadian workers and businesses in their pursuit of a better future. And our Government will continue its pursuit of distinctly Canadian policies that will contribute to a better economy."
40th,1st,Our Government has a clear approach to Canada 's economic security. It will work with its partners to help address the current international crisis. It will maintain a prudent course for the country's finances. It will take action to support the economy today while building a stronger economy for the future.
40th,1st,"As our Government dedicates its efforts over the months ahead to supporting the Canadian economy, so too does it rededicate itself to working in partnership with others to achieve this goal. Canadians expect federal and provincial governments to work together to steer us through the current economic turmoil and, ultimately, build a stronger Canada . To this end, First Ministers met on November 10th and will meet again in the New Year."
40th,1st,Reforming Global Finance 
40th,1st,"The first order of business must be to put the international financial system on a sounder footing. Just as these troubles began beyond our borders, so will their solution demand that Canada engage its partners and allies around the world."
40th,1st,"Canada will use its experience in developing a strong model of financial regulation to help lead the world in the repair and strengthening of the international financial system. The Prime Minister and Minister of Finance began this important work on November 15th, joining the leaders of the G20 in Washington, D.C. , to re-examine and renew the rules and institutions that underpin the global financial system."
40th,1st,"The financial sector exists to serve the economy. Without sound financial institutions, loans would not be available for home ownership. Businesses would be cut off from the credit needed to expand and hire new workers. By choking off financing to the global economy, the credit crisis has dramatically weakened the prospects of growth. Canada will play a leading role to help resolve the crisis, maintain free and open markets, and advance Canada 's interests."
40th,1st,"The credit crisis has also underlined the dangers of a fragmented financial regulatory system. To further strengthen financial oversight in Canada , our Government will work with the provinces to put in place a common securities regulator."
40th,1st,Ensuring Sound Budgeting 
40th,1st,"Canada 's relative success in weathering the global economic turmoil thus far can be attributed in no small measure to our country's solid fiscal fundamentals, the best among all major industrialized countries."
40th,1st,"A strong fiscal foundation is not an end in itself, but it is the bedrock on which a resilient economy is built. Responsible budgets, significant debt repayment, and declining corporate and personal income taxes have provided an important competitive advantage. As Canada navigates today's economic uncertainties, it is even more important that we keep our sights fixed on responsible fiscal management."
40th,1st,The Minister of Finance will provide details on our Government's approach to economic and fiscal management in the Economic and Fiscal Statement to be delivered next week.
40th,1st,"Ongoing, unsustainable deficits are quite rightly unacceptable to Canadians. These structural deficits must never return. At the same time, in a historic global downturn, it would be misguided to commit to a balanced budget in the short term at any cost, because that cost would ultimately be borne by Canadian families."
40th,1st,"Hard decisions will be needed to keep federal spending under control and focused on results. Grants, contributions and capital expenditures will be placed under the microscope of responsible spending. Departments will have the funding they need to deliver essential programs and services, and no more. Our Government will engage Parliament and encourage members to take a more active role in scrutinizing spending and suggesting areas for restraint."
40th,1st,"Our Government is also committed to responsible fiscal management of public sector compensation, and will table legislation to ensure sustainable compensation growth in the federal Public Service."
40th,1st,"Our Government will ensure that the provinces receive the generous transfer payments planned for health care and social programs. We will ensure that equalization payments also grow, but that they do not grow more quickly than our economy as a whole."
40th,1st,Any new measures to support the economy will also be carefully chosen and targeted for maximum benefit.
40th,1st,Securing Jobs for Families and Communities 
40th,1st,Global turbulence is translating into real challenges for Canada . Our Government understands the pressures on ordinary hard-working Canadians and the businesses that provide them with jobs.
40th,1st,"Canada 's economy will only remain as strong as its workers and families. Our Government will strengthen Canada 's workforce for the future by continuing to support student financial assistance and taking measures to encourage skilled trades and apprenticeships. Our Government will also work with the provinces to make the recognition of foreign credentials a priority, attract top international students to Canada and increase the uptake of immigrant settlement programs."
40th,1st,"Our Government will also take steps to ensure that Aboriginal Canadians fully share in economic opportunities, putting particular emphasis on improving education for First Nations in partnership with the provinces and First Nations communities."
40th,1st,Our Government will support workers facing transition. It will ensure that existing programs and services are as effective as possible in meeting the needs of Canadians. Targeted help will be available to those who need it the most.
40th,1st,"Our Government has already cut taxes to lower costs for business and help them compete and create jobs. To further reduce the cost pressures on Canadian business, our Government will take measures to encourage companies to invest in new machinery and equipment."
40th,1st,"The Canadian manufacturing sector, particularly the automotive and aerospace industries, has been under increasing strain. Our Government will provide further support for these industries."
40th,1st,"Canada 's traditional industries, such as fisheries, mining and forestry, sustain the economic well-being of many regions and communities. Our Government will continue to assist these industries through measures aimed at marketing Canadian products abroad and helping businesses to innovate."
40th,1st,Our Government will continue to support Canada 's farmers by ensuring freedom of choice for grain marketing in Western Canada and strongly supporting our supply-managed sectors at home and in international negotiations.
40th,1st,"Public infrastructure is vital not only to create jobs for today, but also to create the links between communities and regions to help generate jobs for the future. Our Government is committed to expediting our Building Canada plan to ensure that projects are delivered as quickly as possible."
40th,1st,Expanding Investment and Trade 
40th,1st,"Canada 's prosperity depends not just on meeting the challenges of today, but on building the dynamic economy that will create opportunities and better jobs for Canadians in the future. As one of our greatest hockey legends has observed, we need ``to skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.''"
40th,1st,"Building a more dynamic economy will require new ideas and new investment. Our Government understands that advances in science and technology are essential to strengthen the competitiveness of Canada 's economy. Our Government will start at home, working with industry to apply the best Canadian scientific and technological know-how to create innovative business solutions. It will invest in new world-class research facilities."
40th,1st,"Our Government will also expand the opportunities for Canadian firms to benefit from foreign investment and knowledge, while taking steps to safeguard consumers and our national security. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize our competition and investment laws, implementing many of the recommendations of the Competition Policy Review Panel."
40th,1st,"Cultural creativity and innovation are vital not only to a lively Canadian cultural life, but also to Canada 's economic future. Our Government will proceed with legislation to modernize Canada 's copyright laws and ensure stronger protection for intellectual property."
40th,1st,"Both investment and trade matter to Canada 's prosperity. Our Government is committed to seeking out new opportunities for Canadians and to promoting global prosperity through free trade. It will work with the new administration in the United States in addressing shared challenges, especially during the current economic downturn, and seek opportunities to enhance North American competitiveness. New trade agreements will be pursued in Asia and the Americas , as well as with the European Union, to open markets for Canadian firms. Our Government will proceed with legislation to ratify the results of trade negotiations that have been concluded with the European Free Trade Association, Peru , Colombia and Jordan ."
40th,1st,"Our Government will continue to invest in expanding gateways on our Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and in vital border corridors such as the Detroit River International Crossing, to ensure that Canadian goods and services can reach markets in Europe, Asia and the United States ."
40th,1st,"Better positioning Canada to compete for investment and market opportunities will require action at home. A fragmented regulatory environment for internal trade and commerce has for too long restricted the flow of labour and investment across the country. Our Government will work with the provinces to remove barriers to internal trade, investment and labour mobility by 2010."
40th,1st,Making Government More Effective 
40th,1st,"Part of a solid economic and fiscal foundation is the sound management of government. To make Canada 's national government more effective, our Government is committed to reform and streamline the way it does business."
40th,1st,"Our Government will pursue innovative reforms to the administration of programs and services, drawing on the successful experiences of other governments around the world. It will build partnerships with third parties and the private sector to deliver better services at a lower overall cost."
40th,1st,Our Government will review all program spending carefully to make sure that spending is as effective as possible and aligned with Canadians' priorities.
40th,1st,Our Government will cut the red tape faced by the private and not-for-profit sectors when doing business with the government.
40th,1st,Fixing procurement will be a top priority. Simpler and streamlined processes will make it easier for businesses to provide products and services to the government and will deliver better results for Canadians. Military procurement in particular is critical: Canada cannot afford to have cumbersome processes delay the purchase and delivery of equipment needed by our men and women in uniform.
40th,1st,"Our Government will also strengthen and improve the management of Canada 's federal agencies, boards, commissions and Crown corporations to achieve greater cost-effectiveness and accountability."
40th,1st,Securing Our Energy Future 
40th,1st,Energy is vitally important to our country. Our geography and climate mean that Canadians depend on affordable and reliable energy. The development of our rich energy resources is an important source of wealth and Canadian jobs.
40th,1st,Our Government will support the development of cleaner energy sources. The natural gas that lies beneath Canada 's North represents both an untapped source of clean fuel and an unequalled avenue to creating economic opportunities for northern people. Our Government will reduce regulatory and other barriers to extend the pipeline network into the North.
40th,1st,"These measures will bring jobs to northern Canada and create employment across the country, just as they will bring new energy supplies to markets in southern Canada and throughout the world. Economic development in Canada 's North, led by a new stand-alone agency, is a key element of our Northern Strategy."
40th,1st,"Nuclear energy is a proven technology, capable of reliable, large-scale output. In Canada and around the world, energy authorities are investing in nuclear power to meet both energy security and climate change goals. Our Government will ensure that Canada 's regulatory framework is ready to respond should the provinces choose to advance new nuclear projects."
40th,1st,Tackling Climate Change and Preserving Canada 's Environment 
40th,1st,"Our Government understands that Canada 's economic prosperity cannot be sustained without a healthy environment, just as environmental progress cannot be achieved without a healthy economy. Our Government will continue its realistic, responsible approach to addressing the challenge of climate change."
40th,1st,"Our Government has committed to reducing Canada 's total greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. We will meet this goal while also ensuring that Canada 's actions going forward remain comparable to what our partners in the United States , Europe and other industrialized countries undertake. We will work with the provincial governments and our partners to develop and implement a North America-wide cap and trade system for greenhouse gases and an effective international protocol for the post-2012 period."
40th,1st,"To meet the challenge posed by climate change, we will also need to make greater use of technologies that do not emit greenhouse gases. Our Government will set an objective that 90 percent of Canada 's electricity needs be provided by non-emitting sources such as hydro, nuclear, clean coal or wind power by 2020. In support of this ambitious national goal, our Government will continue to provide support for biofuels, wind and other energy alternatives."
40th,1st,"To ensure protection of our vital resources, our Government will bring in legislation to ban all bulk water transfers or exports from Canadian freshwater basins."
40th,1st,"Our Government will work with all parties in Parliament to introduce sensible policies that can help consumers and improve our environmental well-being, such as increasing incentives for energy-saving home retrofits."
40th,1st,Helping All Canadians Participate 
40th,1st,"Canada is built on a promise of opportunity, the chance to work hard, raise a family and make a better life. Today, it is more important than ever to deliver on this promise, and ensure that all Canadians share in the promise of this land, regardless of cultural background, gender, age, disability or official language. This Government will break down barriers that prevent Canadians from reaching their potential."
40th,1st,Many working-age Canadians are faced with the dual pressure of holding down a job and caring for their family. Increasing numbers of Canadians are taking care of elderly parents while also raising young children. Our Government is committed to supporting working families and helping make ends meet.
40th,1st,Our Government will improve the Universal Child Care Benefit and take measures to increase access to maternity and parental benefits under Employment Insurance.
40th,1st,We will act to help families caring for loved ones with disabilities and to assist Canadians buying their first home.
40th,1st,"Some Canadians face other barriers to participation in the economy and society, whether in the form of homelessness or debilitating illness. Our Government will extend the Homelessness Partnering Strategy and help more Canadians find affordable housing. It will take creative measures to tackle major heart, lung and neurological diseases and to build on the work of the Mental Health Commission."
40th,1st,Keeping Canadians Safe 
40th,1st,"In times of uncertainty as in times of prosperity, Canadians need to be assured that they are safe in their homes and communities."
40th,1st,"Canadians look to governments to ensure that the justice system is working effectively and that Canadians are safe. Our Government will take tough action against crime and work with partners to improve the administration of justice. Serious offences will be met with serious penalties. Legal provisions will be strengthened in key areas, such as youth crime, organized crime and gang violence. Gun laws will be focused on ending smuggling and stronger penalties for gun crimes, not at criminalizing law-abiding firearms owners. More broadly, Canada 's criminal justice system will be made more efficient. Citizens need to know that justice is served, and that it is served swiftly."
40th,1st,"Safety and security also mean that Canadians must be assured that the food on their dinner table, the toys they buy their children, and the medicines on which they rely are safe. Our Government will follow through with legislation providing better oversight of food, drug and consumer products. It will strengthen the power to recall products and increase penalties for violators. It will also move quickly to launch an independent investigation of this summer's listeria outbreak and act quickly upon its findings."
40th,1st,"National security is the most fundamental duty of any national government to its citizens. Our Government will table a national security statement to explain how we intend to balance the new threats and challenges to national security that we face with the need for oversight, accountability and the protection of civil liberties."
40th,1st,Contributing to Global Security 
40th,1st,Our national security depends on global security. Our Government believes that Canada 's aspirations for a better and more secure world must be matched by vigorous and concrete actions on the world stage.
40th,1st,"Security ultimately depends upon a respect for freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law. Where these values are imperilled, the safety and prosperity of all nations are imperilled. Canada must have the capacity and willingness to stand for what is right, and to contribute to a better and safer world."
40th,1st,"Our Government is transforming Canada 's engagement in Afghanistan to focus on reconstruction and development, and to prepare for the end of our military mission there in 2011. The hard work and heroic sacrifices of Canada 's men and women in the fieldâmilitary, diplomatic and developmentâwill leave the people of Afghanistan the lasting legacy of a more secure, more peaceful and better governed country."
40th,1st,"Our Government will also continue to rebuild and arm the Canadian Forces with the best possible equipment. We will renew all of our major air, sea and surface fleets over the next two decades, creating new, high-technology jobs in Canada in the process."
40th,1st,"Canada 's international assistance will continue to increase and will be spent more effectively in the promotion of development goals. A new, non-partisan democracy promotion agency will also be established to support the peaceful transition to democracy in repressive countries and help emerging democracies build strong institutions."
40th,1st,Building Stronger Institutions 
40th,1st,"Canada 's institutions are the cornerstone of our democracy, our freedom and our prosperity."
40th,1st,"Parliament is Canada 's most important national institution. It is the only forum in which all Canadians, through their elected representatives, have a voice in the governance of the nation. Parliament should be an expression of our highest ideals and deepest values, our greatest hopes and grandest dreams for the future of our children. Our Government believes these ideals can only be achieved if Parliament truly reflects the character and aspirations of the Canadian people."
40th,1st,"Our Government will introduce legislation to move toward representation by population in the House of Commons for Ontario , British Columbia and Alberta . Legislation will also be introduced to allow for nominees to the Senate to be selected by voters, to serve fixed terms of not longer than eight years, and for the Senate to be covered by the same ethics regime as the House of Commons."
40th,1st,"The Public Service of Canada is a key national institution. Public servants inspect our food and police our borders. They deliver programs and services to millions of Canadians in every region of this country, from our largest cities to the most remote Arctic communities. Drawing on the recommendations of the Prime Minister's Advisory Committee on the Public Service, our Government is committed to the continued renewal of the public service."
40th,1st,"Our Government will also take steps to strengthen the Canadian confederation. It will respect the jurisdiction of the provinces and territories and will enshrine its principles of federalism in a Charter of Open Federalism. The federal spending power will be constrained so that any new shared-cost program in an area of exclusive provincial responsibility will require the consent of the majority of the provinces to proceed, and that non-participating provinces can opt out with compensation, provided that they implement compatible programs or initiatives."
40th,1st,Conclusion 
40th,1st,Canadians have renewed their confidence in our Government. They have placed their trust in their representatives. And they have asked us to work together to meet the challenges before our country.
40th,1st,"Our Government is committed to Canada 's continued success at this time of global economic instability. All its energy will be directed to addressing the challenges Canadian families, businesses and workers face, both today and in the future. It will continue to establish effective policies that give a competitive advantage to this country. It will strengthen the institutions that keep Canadians safe, secure and prosperous. And it will work in partnershipâwith its allies, with the provinces and territories, with industry and with the millions of Canadian familiesâto keep Canada the true North, strong and free."
40th,1st,"Canadians have faced times of uncertainty and renewal before and have always emerged a stronger and more united people. Gathered here in this Chamber, we remember the men and women who went before us and the legacy of freedom and prosperity that they have bequeathed to us. It is now our duty to protect and enhance this legacy for those who will follow us."
40th,1st,"Honourable Members of the Senate and Commons, yours is a most important task. May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations."
40th,1st,Stay Connected
39th,1st,"As the representative of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, I am honoured to welcome the newly elected members of the House of Commons on the occasion of the opening of the First Session of the Thirty-Ninth Parliament of Canada. Canadians rejoice in the coming eightieth birthday of Her Majesty later this month, and in her more than fifty years of service as Queen of Canada."
39th,1st,"Since my appointment as Governor General of Canada, I have had the privilege of meeting women and men who each and every day, and each in their own way, reaffirm their attachment to this vast land that we share and where people from around the world have found a home. Women and men of ideas, conviction and action who have an abiding sense of responsibility, solidarity and commitment to their neighbourhoods, to their communities and to their country. And I am moved to see just how strong and vibrant a country we are."
39th,1st,"I have been particularly struck by the words of our young people and by their wealth of ideas. Young people who are looking to carve out their place and be heard. The new generation of Aboriginal entrepreneurs who are creating new opportunities. Young people in our Canadian Forces who, through their extraordinary efforts, offer a promise of hope for the oppressed. More than ever, our young people represent not only the promise of a brighter future, but also the vitality of our present."
39th,1st,"I have met with people from our two great linguistic communities and I can attest that our linguistic duality is a tremendous asset for the country. Similarly, Canadian artists from all disciplines have confirmed to me just how important creative expression is to the health of a democratic society."
39th,1st,And I have heard from Canadians who feel they often lack a voice. Women who are victims of violence. Families newly arrived in Canada who seek to contribute to our society and our country's collective well-being.
39th,1st,"Listening to citizens from all walks of life has strengthened my already deep conviction that we are living in a country where everything is possible, where each of us is free to follow his or her dreams but also has a duty to help build our country and prepare it for the challenges that lie ahead."
39th,1st,"On January 23, the Canadian people elected a new government. The Government is honoured by the responsibility it has been given for managing the affairs of our great country."
39th,1st,"Canada is uniquely blessed in the strength and diversity of its people and regions. Through hard work, foresight and good fortune, we have come together to make our vast country one of the most successful the world has ever seen."
39th,1st,"The distance we have travelled is remarkable. A country once perceived to be at the edge of the world is now at the leading edge of science, business, the arts and sport. Whether it is on the podium in Turin, on the rugged hills of Afghanistan, or in the bustling markets of Asia, Canadians demonstrate time and time again that they are leaders."
39th,1st,"The Government is proud of what Canadians have accomplished so far, and is inspired by the country's bright prospects. It believes in the capacity of Canadians to seize the enormous opportunities before them and build an even stronger Canada, striving for excellence, anchored by enduring values, and infused with growing confidence that they can make a difference at home and in the world."
39th,1st,"In support of building a stronger Canada, the Government's agenda will be clear and focused. It will clean up government, provide real support to ordinary working families and strengthen our federation as well as our role in the world."
39th,1st,Canadians have chosen change. They want a government that treats their tax dollars with respect. A government that puts ordinary working people and their families first. A government that is accountable.
39th,1st,This Government has been given a mandate to lead the change demanded by the Canadian people.
39th,1st,"Leading change in a minority Parliament means working together. To this end, the Government will look for shared goals and common ideas that will help Canadians build a stronger Canada."
39th,1st,It is time to turn a new leaf.
39th,1st,"No aspect of responsible government is more fundamental than having the trust of citizens. Canadians' faith in the institutions and practices of government has been eroded. This new government trusts in the Canadian people, and its goal is that Canadians will once again trust in their government. It is time for accountability."
39th,1st,"To restore this trust, the first piece of legislation the Government will bring forward will be the Federal Accountability Act."
39th,1st,This omnibus legislation and the associated Accountability Action Plan will change the current system of oversight and management by strengthening the rules and institutions that ensure transparency and accountability to Canadians. The legislation will ban institutional and large personal donations to political parties; it will ensure that positions of public trust cannot be used as stepping stones to private lobbying; and it will provide real protection for whistle-blowers who show great courage in coming forward to do what is right.
39th,1st,"The Government will strengthen the capacity and independence of officers of Parliament, including the Auditor General, to hold the Government to account. It will increase the transparency of appointments, contracts and auditing within government departments and Crown corporations."
39th,1st,"Effective checks and balances are important, but they are not enough. The trust of citizens must be earned every day. The Government will work to earn that trust."
39th,1st,"This Government believes that Canadians pay too much in tax. The Government's tax plan will, over time, reduce the tax burden on all Canadians."
39th,1st,"To this end, the Government will reduce the Goods and Services Tax by one percent. Cutting the GST will help all Canadians deal with the rising cost of living, put money back in people's pockets and help stimulate the economy."
39th,1st,"Cutting the GST is the best way to lower taxes for all Canadians, including low-income Canadians who need it most."
39th,1st,"The Government will continue with a responsible approach to lowering taxes for the benefit of Canadians and the Canadian economy, including a further reduction of the GST to five percent."
39th,1st,Canadians have always taken pride in our low crime rates. Safe streets have long characterized Canada's communities -- from villages to towns to cities. Safe communities allow families and businesses to prosper.
39th,1st,"Unfortunately, our safe streets and healthy communities are increasingly under threat of gun, gang and drug violence."
39th,1st,"This Government will tackle crime. It will propose changes to the Criminal Code to provide tougher sentences for violent and repeat offenders, particularly those involved in weapons-related crimes. It will help prevent crime by putting more police on the street and improving the security of our borders."
39th,1st,"It is equally important that we prevent criminal behaviour before it has a chance to take root. To this end, the Government will work with the provinces and territories to help communities provide hope and opportunity for our youth, and end the cycle of violence that can lead to broken communities and broken lives."
39th,1st,Strong families ensure a bright future for Canada. The most important investment we can make as a country is to help families raise their children.
39th,1st,"This Government understands that no two Canadian families are exactly alike. Each has its own circumstances and needs. Parents must be able to choose the child care that is best for them. The Government will help Canadian parents, as they seek to balance work and family life, by supporting their child care choices through direct financial support."
39th,1st,"In collaboration with the provinces and territories, employers and community non-profit organizations, it will also encourage the creation of new child care spaces."
39th,1st,"Canadians have paid their taxes to support our system of public health insurance. But all too often, they find themselves waiting too long for critical procedures. That is not good enough. It is time Canadians received the health care they have paid for."
39th,1st,The Government will engage the provinces and territories on a patient wait times guarantee for medically necessary services. This guarantee will make sure that all Canadians receive essential medical treatment within clinically acceptable waiting times.
39th,1st,A health system that is timely and sustainable will require innovation. The Government will support and enable innovative approaches to health care delivery consistent with the principles of a universally accessible and equitable public health care system embodied in the Canada Health Act.
39th,1st,One of Canada's greatest strengths is our federal system of government. The founders of our country had the foresight to build a flexible federal system that would accommodate our diversity and build upon the unique strengths of the different parts of our federation.
39th,1st,"To remain strong and effective, our federation must keep pace with the evolving needs of Canadian society. Building on the work begun in the last Parliament, this Government will seek to involve parliamentarians and citizens in examining the challenges facing Canada's electoral system and democratic institutions. At the same time, it will explore means to ensure that the Senate better reflects both the democratic values of Canadians and the needs of Canada's regions."
39th,1st,"All too often, the strength of our federation is compromised by jurisdictional squabbles that obscure accountabilities and prevent governments from working together in the best interests of Canadians."
39th,1st,"This new government will take a new approach. It is committed to building a better federation in which governments come together to help Canadians realize their potential. To this end, the Government will respond to concerns about the fiscal imbalance and will work to ensure fiscal arrangements in which all governments have access to the resources they need to meet their responsibilities."
39th,1st,"The Government is committed to an open federalism that recognizes the unique place of a strong, vibrant Quebec in a united Canada. It will work with the government and legislature of Quebec in a spirit of mutual respect and collaboration to advance the aspirations of Quebecers. In the international community, Canada is stronger when we speak with one voice, but that voice must belong to all of us. In a more interdependent world, decisions on international issues increasingly affect not only countries, but also individuals, communities and regions."
39th,1st,"This is why the Government will facilitate provincial participation in the development of Canadian positions that affect areas of provincial responsibility. The Government recognizes the special cultural responsibilities of the Government of Quebec and will therefore invite Quebec to play a role in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. By harnessing the diversity of experience and expertise found within our federation, we can present a strong, united and confident voice to the world."
39th,1st,"Canada's voice in the world must be supported by action, both at home and abroad. Advancing our interests in a complex and sometimes dangerous world requires confidence and the independent capacity to defend our country's sovereignty and the security of our citizens."
39th,1st,"The Government will work cooperatively with our friends and allies and constructively with the international community to advance common values and interests. In support of this goal, it will build stronger multilateral and bilateral relationships, starting with Canada's relationship with the United States, our best friend and largest trading partner."
39th,1st,"More broadly, this Government is committed to supporting Canada's core values of freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights around the world. In this regard, the Government will support a more robust diplomatic role for Canada, a stronger military and a more effective use of Canadian aid dollars."
39th,1st,"Just as it honours the past efforts of our veterans, the Government stands firmly behind the vital role being played by our troops in Afghanistan today. The dedicated Canadians in Afghanistan deserve all of our support as they risk their lives to defend our national interests, combat global terrorism and help the Afghan people make a new start as a free, democratic and peaceful country."
39th,1st,"The Government's clear and focused agenda reflects its commitment to Canadians. It will not try to do all things at once. Instead, the Government will work diligently to make tangible improvements that contribute to stronger families and safer communities, and a stronger country."
39th,1st,"During this Thirty-Ninth Parliament, the Government will be bringing forward fiscally responsible budgets and a legislative program that will achieve the results that Canadians expect from their elected representatives. In this work, it will rely on the support and counsel of a dedicated and professional Public Service. In turn, it will give the Public Service the leadership and tools it needs to excel in the service of Canadians. Recognizing the important role of parliamentarians, members of Parliament will be asked to conduct comprehensive reviews of key federal legislation, including the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, the Anti-Terrorism Act and the Bank Act. The Government will act in Parliament to offer an apology for the Chinese Head Tax. Significant international treaties will be submitted for votes in Parliament."
39th,1st,"Over the course of its mandate, and starting with the clear priorities set out today, the Government will work diligently to build a record of results. It will promote a more competitive, more productive Canadian economy. It will seek to improve opportunity for all Canadians, including Aboriginal peoples and new immigrants. It will work to improve the security of seniors. It will take measures to achieve tangible improvements in our environment, including reductions in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions."
39th,1st,"This Government recognizes the unique challenges faced by those who make their livelihood from our land and oceans in our vital natural resource and agriculture industries. It will take action to secure a prosperous future for Canadian agriculture, following years of neglect. It will respond to short-term needs, create separate and more effective farm income stabilization and disaster relief programs and work with producers and partners to achieve long-term competitiveness and sustainability."
39th,1st,"Together, the Government's actions will ensure Canada's future success."
39th,1st,"With the efforts and contributions of members from both chambers, the Government looks forward to making this Parliament work for the benefit of the Canadian people."
39th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
39th,1st,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
39th,1st,Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons:
39th,1st,May Divine Providence guide your deliberations.

39th,2nd,"At 7 p.m., Her Excellency the Governor General proceeded to the Senate Chamber and took her seat upon the Throne. Her Excellency was pleased to command the attendance of the House of Commons, and, that House being come, with their Speaker, Her Excellency was pleased to open the Second Session of the Thirty-ninth Parliament of Canada with the following speech:"
39th,2nd,"Honourable Senators, "
39th,2nd,"Members of the House of Commons, "
39th,2nd,"Ladies and Gentlemen, "
39th,2nd,"I would like to address the first words in this chamber to the members of the Canadian Forces, some of whom are present here today. Their commitment and courage in the name of justice, equality and freedom â whose benefits are not accorded to all peoples in the world â are worthy of our utmost respect."
39th,2nd,"The Speech from the Throne is an important moment in our country's democratic life. Through the Speech from the Throne, the Government shares its vision with Canadians. And it is thus that we open the Second Session of the Thirty- ninth Parliament today."
39th,2nd,"Fifty years ago, on October 14, 1957, during her first visit to Canada as its Sovereign, and for the first time in Canadian history, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II opened the First Session of the Twenty-third Parliament."
39th,2nd,"This room is filled with history, and we mark history again this year as we celebrate a number of anniversaries. I think, in particular, of the bicentenary of the Abolition of the Slave Trade Act in the British Empire . I also think of the 60th anniversary of the adoption of the Citizenship Act on January 1, 1947. And I think of the 40th anniversary of the Order of Canada , whose one hundredth investiture ceremony we will soon be celebrating at Rideau Hall."
39th,2nd,"And although Canada is a young country, its history is marked by our unwavering willingness â which I was touched to see all across Canada â to be and to continue to be a generous society. A society that is concerned about the well being of others. A society that is protective of the spirit of this bountiful land, a deep respect learned from Aboriginal peoples. A society that is committed to finding solutions to today's challenges. A society that is open to creation and quick to innovate. A society that is filled with young people who have an unprecedented openness to the world."
39th,2nd,STRONG LEADERSHIP.  A BETTER CANADA . 
39th,2nd,"Canada is the greatest country in the world, a nation of enormous potential built through the imagination and dedication of ordinary Canadians. Canadians who have worked hard to build a better life for their families. Canadians who have joined with their neighbours to create a society founded on peace and prosperity."
39th,2nd,Canada is their legacy to us.
39th,2nd,Canadians expect their government to help them build on this legacy. They want a government that sets clear goals and delivers concrete results. A government that is accountable. A government that puts Canadians and their families first.
39th,2nd,Our Government has worked hard to meet these expectations. Canadians now have more money in their pockets because taxes have been cut. Families now have real choice in child care through the Universal Child Care Benefit. Canadians now have a government committed to helping them get the medical care they need more quickly. A government that is tackling crime and making neighbourhoods safer.
39th,2nd,"The results are clear: the economy is strong, the government is clean and the country is united."
39th,2nd,"Now is the time to continue building a better Canada . In the next session, our Government will focus on five clear priorities: strengthening Canada 's sovereignty and place in the world; building a stronger federation; providing effective economic leadership; continuing to tackle crime; and improving our environment."
39th,2nd,STRENGTHENING CANADA 'S SOVEREIGNTY AND PLACE IN THE WORLD 
39th,2nd,"Canada is built on a common heritage of values, which Canadians have fought and died to defend. It is a country that continues to attract newcomers seeking refuge and opportunity, who see Canada as a place where they can work hard, raise families and live in freedom. Our Government is resolved to uphold this heritage by protecting our sovereignty at home and living by our values abroad."
39th,2nd,"The Arctic is an essential part of Canada 's history. One of our Fathers of Confederation, D'Arcy McGee, spoke of Canada as a northern nation, bounded by the blue rim of the ocean. Canadians see in our North an expression of our deepest aspirations: our sense of exploration, the beauty and the bounty of our land, and our limitless potential."
39th,2nd,"But the North needs new attention. New opportunities are emerging across the Arctic , and new challenges from other shores. Our Government will bring forward an integrated northern strategy focused on strengthening Canada 's sovereignty, protecting our environmental heritage, promoting economic and social development, and improving and devolving governance, so that northerners have greater control over their destinies."
39th,2nd,"To take advantage of the North's vast opportunities, northerners must be able to meet their basic needs. Our Government will work to continue to improve living conditions in the North for First Nations and Inuit through better housing."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will build a world-class Arctic research station that will be on the cutting edge of Arctic issues, including environmental science and resource development. This station will be built by Canadians, in Canada 's Arctic , and it will be there to serve the world."
39th,2nd,"As part of asserting sovereignty in the Arctic, our Government will complete comprehensive mapping of Canada 's Arctic seabed. Never before has this part of Canada 's ocean floor been fully mapped."
39th,2nd,"Defending our sovereignty in the North also demands that we maintain the capacity to act. New Arctic patrol ships and expanded aerial surveillance will guard Canada 's Far North and the Northwest Passage . As well, the size and capabilities of the Arctic Rangers will be expanded to better patrol our vast Arctic territory."
39th,2nd,"Ensuring our capacity to defend Canada 's sovereignty is at the heart of the Government's efforts to rebuild the Canadian Forces. Canada 's men and women in uniform risk their lives for their country, and deserve the equipment and training required for a first-class, modern military. Our Government will modernize Canada 's military to provide effective surveillance and protection for all of our country, cooperate in the defence of North America , and meet our responsibilities abroad to the United Nations and our allies. Further, recognizing the important role that the Reserves play in this modernization, our Government will work with the provinces and territories to bring forward a comprehensive plan to modernize reservist reinstatement policies."
39th,2nd,"At the same time as our Government rebuilds to meet our future needs, it will continue to improve support for our veterans who have contributed so much to defending Canada in the past."
39th,2nd,"Rebuilding our capabilities and standing up for our sovereignty have sent a clear message to the world: Canada is back as a credible player on the international stage. Our Government believes that focus and action, rather than rhetoric and posturing, are restoring our influence in global affairs. Guided by our shared values of democracy, freedom, human rights and the rule of law, our Government will continue Canada 's international leadership through concrete actions that bring results."
39th,2nd,A commitment to action means that Canada must make common cause with those fighting for the values we uphold. Our Government will immediately call upon Parliament to confer honorary citizenship on Aung San Suu Kyi . Her long struggle to bring freedom and democracy to the people of Burma has made her the embodiment of these ideals and an inspiration to all of us.
39th,2nd,"Nowhere is Canada making a difference more clearly than in Afghanistan . Canada has joined the United Nations- sanctioned mission in Afghanistan because it is noble and necessary. Canadians understand that development and security go hand in hand. Without security, there can be no humanitarian aid, no reconstruction and no democratic development. Progress will be slow, but our efforts are bearing fruit. There is no better measure of this progress than the four million Afghan boys and two million girls who can dream of a better future because they now go to school."
39th,2nd,"The Canadian Forces mission in Afghanistan has been approved by Parliament until February 2009, and our Government has made clear to Canadians and our allies that any future military deployments must also be supported by a majority of parliamentarians. In the coming session, members will be asked to vote on the future of the Canadian mission in Afghanistan . This decision should honour the dedication and sacrifice of Canada 's development workers, diplomats and men and women in uniform. It should ensure that progress in Afghanistan is not lost and that our international commitments and reputation are upheld."
39th,2nd,"Our Government does not believe that Canada should simply abandon the people of Afghanistan after February 2009. Canada should build on its accomplishments and shift to accelerate the training of the Afghan army and police so that the Afghan government can defend its own sovereignty. This will not be completed by February 2009, but our Government believes this objective should be achievable by 2011, the end of the period covered by the Afghanistan Compact. Our Government has appointed an independent panel to advise Canadians on how best to proceed given these considerations."
39th,2nd,"In our own neighbourhood, the Americas , Canada is back playing an active role. The Canadian model of constitutional democracy and economic openness combined with social safety nets, equitable wealth creation and sharing across regions has much to offer those countries struggling to build a better future."
39th,2nd,"Canada 's efforts in Haiti are a compelling example of how we can work with our neighbours to ensure security and development. Canadians understand that our country has a responsibility to help countries struggling to make a better life for their people â particularly in promoting democratic governance in fragile states. In Haiti and elsewhere, our Government will bring greater focus and effectiveness to Canada 's international assistance to ensure that Canadians' money is well spent."
39th,2nd,"The best hope for fostering development and our common security in the hemisphere and beyond is through bolstering international trade. Through renewed focus on trade and investment arrangements, Canada has already secured a deal with the European Free Trade Association, the first new agreement in more than half a decade. Our Government will keep advancing Canada 's trade interests in the Americas and around the world to open up new markets for Canada 's innovators."
39th,2nd,STRENGTHENING THE FEDERATION AND OUR DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS 
39th,2nd,"Next year we mark important anniversaries spanning our country and its history. We will celebrate the 400th anniversary of the founding of Quebec City . Canada was born in French, reflected in the presence of francophones throughout Canada , and in Parliament's recognition that the QuÃ©bÃ©cois form a nation within our united country."
39th,2nd,"We will also celebrate the 250th anniversary of the establishment of Nova Scotia 's representative assembly, which marks the birth of Canadian parliamentary democracy, and the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Crown Colony of British Columbia."
39th,2nd,"John A. Macdonald, George- Ãtienne Cartier and the other Fathers of Confederation brought many peoples and regions together to create a federation that has served Canadians well for 140 years."
39th,2nd,"Our Government is committed to strengthening that union: it has concentrated on its national role by reinvesting in neglected federal responsibilities, such as trade, defence, public safety and security. It has put fiscal relations with provinces and territories on a principled basis and increased the level of transfers to support quality health care and social services."
39th,2nd,"Our Government believes that the constitutional jurisdiction of each order of government should be respected. To this end, guided by our federalism of openness, our Government will introduce legislation to place formal limits on the use of the federal spending power for new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction. This legislation will allow provinces and territories to opt out with reasonable compensation if they offer compatible programs."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will also pursue the federal government's rightful leadership in strengthening Canada 's economic union. Despite the globalization of markets, Canada still has a long way to go to establish free trade among our provinces. It is often harder to move goods and services across provincial boundaries than across our international borders. This hurts our competitive position but, more importantly, it is just not the way a country should work. Our Government will consider how to use the federal trade and commerce power to make our economic union work better for Canadians."
39th,2nd,"Canadians understand that the federation is only as strong as the democratic institutions that underpin it. Our Government believes that Canada is not well served by the Senate in its current form. To ensure that our institutions reflect our shared commitment to democracy, our Government will continue its agenda of democratic reform by reintroducing important pieces of legislation from the last session, including direct consultations with voters on the selection of Senators and limitations on their tenure."
39th,2nd,"In addition, the integrity of our federal voting system will be further strengthened through measures to confirm the visual identification of voters."
39th,2nd,Our Government supports Canada 's linguistic duality. It will renew its commitment to official languages in Canada by developing a strategy for the next phase of the Action Plan for Official Languages.
39th,2nd,"Our Government remains committed to improving the lives of Canada 's Aboriginal people. The Government will reintroduce legislation to guarantee to people living on reserve the same protections other Canadians enjoy under the Canadian Human Rights Act . Our Government will also present legislation on specific claims, which will finally bring fairness and timely resolution to the claims process."
39th,2nd,"Our Government recently concluded a final settlement on Indian Residential Schools and will launch a commission for truth and reconciliation. The Prime Minister, on behalf of our Government, will use this occasion to make a statement of apology to close this sad chapter in our history."
39th,2nd,PROVIDING EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP FOR A PROSPEROUS FUTURE 
39th,2nd,"This is a time of economic uncertainty and volatility in the wider world. While the economic fundamentals of our country are strong, Canada is not immune from this turbulence. Canadians understand these challenges and want a government that is a competent and effective manager of the economy."
39th,2nd,"With Advantage Canada , our Government has laid out a sensible economic plan to secure better-paying jobs and solid growth for Canadians. The Minister of Finance will soon provide a Fall Economic and Fiscal Update, which will outline the next steps in that plan to ensure that Canada has a modern infrastructure, an innovative and entrepreneurial business environment, and a tax system that rewards hard work â all based on a foundation of sound fiscal management."
39th,2nd,"As part of ensuring economic security for Canadians, our Government will bring forward a long-term plan of broad- based tax relief for individuals, businesses and families â including following through on its commitment to a further cut to the GST. To complement this, our Government will support Canadian researchers and innovators in developing new ideas and bringing them to the marketplace through Canada 's Science and Technology Strategy."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will improve the protection of cultural and intellectual property rights in Canada , including copyright reform. Our Government will also take measures to improve the governance and management of the Employment Insurance Account."
39th,2nd,The bedrock of our workforce is middle-class Canadians and their families. These families worry about the rising costs of higher education and the expense of caring for elderly parents. They worry about affordable housing and the number of homeless people on our streets.
39th,2nd,"Our Government is committed to helping Canadian families meet their needs. The Working Income Tax Benefit will help Canadians get back into the workforce, and the registered disability savings plan will help families care for children with severe disabilities. Our Government will continue to invest in our families and our future, and will help those seeking to break free from the cycles of homelessness and poverty."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will announce an infrastructure program, the Building Canada Plan, to support our long- term growth. By investing in our transport and trade hubs, including the Windsor â Detroit corridor and the Atlantic and Pacific gateways, our Government will help rebuild our fundamentals for continued growth."
39th,2nd,"The result will be safer roads and bridges, shorter commutes, more competitive business, improved cultural infrastructure and a better quality of life for all Canadians."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will stand up for Canada 's traditional industries. Key sectors including forestry, fisheries, manufacturing and tourism are facing challenges. Our Government has taken action to support workers as these industries adjust to global conditions and will continue to do so in the next session."
39th,2nd,"The agricultural sector will benefit from our Government's promotion of biofuels and the new Growing Forward agricultural framework. Our Government will recognize the views of farmers, as expressed in the recent plebiscite on barley, by enacting marketing choice. Together with our Government's strong support for Canada 's supply- managed system, these approaches will deliver stable, predictable and bankable support for farm families."
39th,2nd,"Our mining and resource sectors present extraordinary opportunities across Canada , and our Government will help move forward by providing a single window for major project approvals. With these increased opportunities for employment, our Government will continue to foster partnerships that help Aboriginal people get the skills and training to take advantage of these job prospects in the North and across Canada ."
39th,2nd,TACKLING CRIME AND STRENGTHENING THE SECURITY OF CANADIANS 
39th,2nd,"Canada was founded on the principles of peace, order and good government. This is the birthright of all Canadians; yet Canadians feel less safe today and rightly worry about the security of their neighbourhoods and the country. There is no greater responsibility for a government than to protect this right to safety and security."
39th,2nd,"In the last session, our Government introduced important and timely legislation to tackle violent crime. Unfortunately much of this legislation did not pass. That is not good enough to maintain the confidence of Canadians. Our Government will immediately reintroduce these measures with a single, comprehensive Tackling Violent Crime bill to protect Canadians and their communities from violent criminals and predators. This will include measures on the age of protection, impaired driving, dangerous offenders and stricter bail and mandatory prison sentences for those who commit gun crimes. Canadians expect prompt passage of this crucial legislation."
39th,2nd,"Our Government will go further with a Safer Communities strategy to deal with the critical intersection of drug, youth and property crime. Our Government will strengthen the Youth Criminal Justice Act  to ensure that young offenders who commit serious crimes are held accountable to victims and their communities. Our Government will introduce tough new laws to tackle property crime, including the serious problem of auto theft. New measures to address elder abuse and to curb identity theft will also be introduced. Our Government will implement the National Anti-Drug Strategy giving law enforcement agencies powers to take on those who produce and push drugs on our streets."
39th,2nd,"In addition to tougher laws, our Government will provide targeted support to communities and victims. It will help families and local communities in steering vulnerable youth away from a life of drugs and crime, and the Anti-Drug Strategy will help to treat those suffering from drug addiction. It will again ask Parliament to repeal the wasteful long-gun registry. Our Government will also ensure effective law enforcement â starting with resources to recruit 2,500 more officers to police our streets."
39th,2nd,The concern of Canadians in protecting our communities extends naturally to protecting our country against threats to our national security: those who would attack the peaceful pluralism of our society through acts of terrorism. Canada has experienced the tragedy of terrorism before. The report from the public inquiry into the Air India bombing will be an important contribution to safeguarding the lives of Canadians in the future.
39th,2nd,"Our Government will address Canadians directly on the challenge of protecting our free and open society with a statement on national security. The Government will introduce legislation to make sure that Canada has the tools it needs to stop those who would threaten our cities, communities and families, including measures to strengthen the  Anti-Terrorism Act and to respond to the Supreme Court decision on security certificates."
39th,2nd,IMPROVING THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH OF CANADIANS 
39th,2nd,Threats to our environment are a clear and present danger that now confronts governments around the world. This is nowhere more evident than in the growing challenge of climate change.
39th,2nd,"Our Government believes that action is needed now to ensure our quality of life, particularly for those most vulnerable to health threats from the environment â our children and seniors."
39th,2nd,"Climate change is a global issue and requires a global solution. Our Government believes strongly that an effective global approach to greenhouse gas emissions must have binding targets that apply to all major emitters, including Canada . Canada has already engaged the international community at APEC, the G8 and the United Nations and will continue to press for a new international agreement that cuts global emissions in half by 2050."
39th,2nd,"As we pursue a global consensus, Canada is acting even more aggressively at home. Our Government will implement our national strategy to reduce Canada 's total greenhouse gas emissions 60 to 70 percent by 2050. There will be a 20 percent reduction by 2020. Our Government will bring forward the elements from Canada 's Clean Air Act, which had all-party consensus, for parliamentary consideration."
39th,2nd,"This strategy will institute binding national regulations on greenhouse gas emissions across all major industrial sectors â with requirements for emissions reductions starting this year. Our Government will also bring forward the first-ever national air pollution regulations. In so doing, our Government will put Canada at the forefront of clean technologies to reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Our Government will also establish a carbon emissions trading market that will give business the incentive to run cleaner, greener operations."
39th,2nd,"At the end of 2005, Canada 's greenhouse gas emissions were 33 percent above the Kyoto commitment. It is now widely understood that, because of inaction on greenhouse gases over the last decade, Canada 's emissions cannot be brought to the level required under the Kyoto Protocol within the compliance period, which begins on January 1, 2008, just 77 days from now."
39th,2nd,"The world is moving on to address climate change and the environment, and Canada intends to help lead the effort at home and abroad."
39th,2nd,"Beyond regulating greenhouse gases and air pollution, our Government has also acted to protect sensitive areas, including a massive expansion of Nahanni National Park, and preserving the Great Bear Rainforest, Point Pleasant Park and Stanley Park. Through our new infrastructure plan, our Government will promote a cleaner environment by investing in public transport and water treatment, and by cleaning up contaminated sites. A new water strategy will be implemented to help clean up our major lakes and oceans and to improve access to safe drinking water for First Nations."
39th,2nd,"In the past, environmental legislation and regulation have had little impact because they have lacked an effective enforcement regime. In the coming session, our Government will bolster the protection of our water and land through tougher environmental enforcement that will make polluters accountable."
39th,2nd,Environmental protection is not just about protecting nature. It is about the health of Canadians. Recent events have called into question the safety of basic products such as food for our families and toys for our children.
39th,2nd,Our Government shares the concern of parents about the safety of consumer products and food. Canadians should expect the same standards of quality from imported goods as they do from products made at home. The Government will introduce measures on food and product safety to ensure that families have confidence in the quality and safety of what they buy.
39th,2nd,CONCLUSION: THE NORTH STAR 
39th,2nd,Canadians can be proud of their country and its achievements. Working together we have built a nation that is prosperous and safe; a land where merit trumps privilege; a place where people from around the world live in harmony; a federation that is united at home and respected abroad.
39th,2nd,"Like the North Star, Canada has been a guide to other nations; through difficult times, Canada has shone as an example of what a people joined in common purpose can achieve. Yet Canada 's greatest strength lies in its energy and determination to move forward and build a better future."
39th,2nd,Our Government is committed to strong leadership to realize that future. A Canada proud of its leadership in the world and confident in its economic future. A Canada built on a strong federation and a robust democracy. A Canada that is safe for our families and healthy for our children.
39th,2nd,"Canadians, standing on a proud history, look onto a horizon as limitless as the promise of our country. It is up to us to build on the legacy we have inherited, to seize the opportunities of the future, and to bring about an even better Canada for our children."
39th,2nd,"May your deliberations be guided by Divine Providence, may your wisdom and patriotism enlarge the prosperity of the country and promote in every way the well-being of its people."
39th,2nd,The House of Commons withdrew.
39th,2nd,Her Excellency the Governor General was pleased to retire.

38th,1st,"HONOURABLE MEMBERS OF THE SENATE,MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS,LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:"
38th,1st,"I congratulate both the returning members of Parliament, as well as the more than one hundred who are newly elected, as you take up your duties in the House of Commons for this Thirty-Eighth Parliament of Canada."
38th,1st,"This year, Canadians commemorated the 60th anniversary of D-Day and the landing of allied forces in Europeâan event that spelled the beginning of the end of the Second World War. Canadian soldiers, sailors and aircrews fought with dogged bravery and were ultimately victorious on Juno Beach that day."
38th,1st,"Shortly, I will be going to Italy to commemorate the significant campaign in which six thousand Canadians sacrificed their lives. To me, personally, these commemorations are a symbol of our eternal gratitude and an affirmation that we have not forgotten."
38th,1st,"On these occasions, we are reminded of the huge debt we owe to those in uniform who have served this countryâthen and today. Our veterans connect generations and Canadians. As a country and as individuals, we gain in pride and in purpose from their deeds and their service."
38th,1st,"I recently concluded extended visits to six cities of varying sizeâSaint John, Quebec City, Toronto, Saskatoon, Calgary and Vancouver. In them, I found remarkable, innovative projects for social renewal and individual commitment. They express the confidence and love that we all hold for this country. This is the spirit of Canada I see as Governor General."
38th,1st,"The Government starts this new session with a commitment that all parliamentarians shareâregardless of political affiliationâto contribute to real progress for Canadians, for this country, for our future. The Government faces a new Parliament fresh from an election. The people of Canada want this Government, and all parliamentarians, to rise above partisanship to address the public interest. They want their political leaders to catch up with Canadiansâ own ambitions for the country and their readiness to take on the world with confidence."
38th,1st,"Each of us must take responsibility. The Government will do its part to ensure that this minority Parliament works. Working together, we can unite the voices of all Canadians in common purpose."
38th,1st,The Governmentâs actions on behalf of Canadians will be guided by these seven commitments:
38th,1st,"Together, we can move Canada forward."
38th,1st,A STRONG ECONOMY
38th,1st,"Our quality of life, job opportunities and capacity to support our social goals rely on a globally competitive economy."
38th,1st,"Canada has a solid record of economic achievement. Over the past 10 years, we generated over three million new jobs. Since 1997, we have led all G7 countries in the growth of living standards. And low interest rates have made home ownership easier than it has been in decades."
38th,1st,"This has not happened by accident. A virtuous circle led to increased confidence, lower interest rates and robust growth of well-paying jobs. The increase in revenues and the recovery of fiscal sovereignty have in turn permitted the Government to reduce and improve the fairness of taxes, and make new social and economic investments. This virtuous circle will continue."
38th,1st,"We have been successful, but we will not be complacent. The Government will not spend itself into deficit. It will continue to pay down debt. Its objective is to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 per cent within 10 years. It will provide transparent, accountable management, treating every tax dollar with respect. The Government will make the difficult decisions among competing priorities and systematically review all expenditures, reallocating from old to new, from past to future."
38th,1st,"Canada must now elevate its economic performance to the next level. Advancing technology and pervasive global competition demand of Canada a commitment to excellence, the pursuit of greater productivity, and a vision directed outward to the challenges and opportunities the world presents."
38th,1st,The Government will pursue a five-point strategy to build an even more globally competitive and sustainable economy.
38th,1st,"The first element is to invest in people, Canadaâs greatest source of creativity and economic strength."
38th,1st,"We must invest in helping workers to continuously enhance their skills to keep pace with constantly evolving workplace requirements. To that end, the Government will develop a new Workplace Skills Strategy, including steps to enhance apprenticeship systems, and to boost literacy and other essential job skills. This will be Â complemented by up-to-date training facilities and labour market agreements to be developed in collaboration with the provinces and territories, unions and sector councils."
38th,1st,The Government will continue to review the Employment Insurance program to ensure that it remains well-suited to the needs of Canadaâs workforce.
38th,1st,"Efforts to improve the recognition of foreign credentials and prior work experience have yielded too little progress. Looking to the growing contribution that will be required from new Canadians as our population ages, this Government will redouble its efforts, in cooperation with the provinces and professional bodies, to help integrate them into the workforce."
38th,1st,"To increase access to post-secondary education, the Government will introduce legislation to implement its Learning Bond, an innovative savings vehicle that it announced to help low-income families provide for their childrenâs post-secondary education."
38th,1st,The second element of the economic strategy is to strengthen Canadaâs ability to generate and apply new ideas.
38th,1st,"The Government of Canada has made substantial investmentsâmore than $13 billion since 1997âthat have built a strong foundation in basic science and technology, including the Canada Foundation for Innovation, health research and other initiatives to create leading-edge capabilities. It will continue to build on this strength."
38th,1st,"The National Science Advisor is assisting the Government to ensure that these investments are strategic, focused and delivering results, and is working to bring about a fuller integration of the Governmentâs substantial in-house science and technology activity."
38th,1st,"The next challenge is to turn more of Canadiansâ bright ideas into dynamic businesses, great jobs and growing export earnings. To that end, the Government will ensure a supply of venture capital, particularly for early-stage businessesâfor example, through the venture financing arm of the Business Development Bank of Canada."
38th,1st,"The Government will develop policies to foster Canadian capabilities in key enabling technologiesâsuch as biotechnology, information and communications, and advanced materialsâwhich will be drivers of innovation and productivity in the 21st century economy."
38th,1st,Providing âsmart governmentââthe third element of our economic strategyâaims to make it easier for businesses to do business in Canada.
38th,1st,Smart government includes a transparent and predictable regulatory system that accomplishes public policy objectives efficiently while eliminating unintended impacts. This can be a key competitive advantage for Canada. That is why the Government welcomes the just-released report of the External Advisory Committee on Smart Regulation.
38th,1st,Smart government also includes providing an up-to-date legislative framework for business. The Government will therefore propose changes to modernize the Competition Act.
38th,1st,The fourth element of the Governmentâs overall economic strategy is a commitment to regional and sectoral development.
38th,1st,"The Government will do its part to enable the success of important sectors, including automotive, aerospace and other manufacturing, as well as agriculture and other resource-based industries."
38th,1st,"Canadaâs regional economies are a vital source of economic strength and stability. Support for regional and rural economic development will target the fundamentalsâskills upgrading, support for research and development, community development, and modern infrastructure such as broadband communicationâby employing the regional agencies and tools such as the Atlantic Innovation Fund."
38th,1st,The Governmentâs regional objectives will be complemented by the most fundamental reform of the Equalization program in its 47-year history. The objective is to make more stable and predictable the total payments by the federal government to the less-wealthy provinces in support of key public services.
38th,1st,"A region of particular challenge and opportunity is Canadaâs Northâa vast area of unique cultural and ecological significance. The Government will develop, in cooperation with its territorial partners, Aboriginal people and other northern residents, the first-ever comprehensive strategy for the North. This northern strategy will foster sustainable economic and human development; protect the northern environment and Canadaâs sovereignty and security; and promote cooperation with the international circumpolar community."
38th,1st,Promotion of trade and investment is the fifth pillar of the Governmentâs economic strategy.
38th,1st,"Strong investment will be the primary generator of growth and good jobs for the future. The Government will foster investment by attending to the conditions that encourage entrepreneurs and providers of risk capital. These include sound monetary and fiscal policies as well as competitive taxes, efficiently targeted to promote economic growth."
38th,1st,"Canada has always been a trading nation, but never more so than today. It is therefore vital that we secure and enhance our access to markets, both in North America and the world. To this end, the Government will continue to push for an open, rules-based international trading system and a successful conclusion of the Doha Round of global trade negotiations."
38th,1st,Issues such as softwood lumber and BSE underline the importance the Government attaches to obtaining more reliable access to U.S. markets. It will build on the successful Smart Borders initiative and on measures designed to develop a more sophisticated and informed relationship involving business and government officials in the United States.
38th,1st,"The Government will enhance its capacity to expand international trade and commerce, with a particular focus on North America and emerging markets."
38th,1st,"To complement its international commerce initiatives, the Government is determined to forge a stronger Canadian economic union, free of the internal barriers that still diminish opportunities and reduce our competitiveness."
38th,1st,THE HEALTH OF CANADIANS
38th,1st,"Canadians have told their governments, year after year, to renew Medicare, to stop bickering and work together to ensure that it will be there for them and their children. Governments have responded. On September 15, all fourteen First Ministers agreed on the Ten-year Plan to Strengthen Health Care."
38th,1st,"The Plan sets out a clear commitment, shared by all provinces and territories, to achieve tangible resultsâresults for patients. What united all First Ministers was the commitment to a meaningful reduction in wait times for health services because it is key to transforming the health system. The Plan holds all governments to account by establishing a requirement for evidence-based benchmarks, comparable indicators, clear targets and transparent reporting to the public on access to health care. This means that the needs of patients will drive change."
38th,1st,"The Plan will accelerate reform and ensure better access to key tests and treatments. It will increase the number of doctors, nurses and other health professionals. This will be helped by quicker assessment and integration of those who have received their training abroad. The Plan will improve access to home and community care services and to safe and affordable drugs."
38th,1st,"The Plan commits to a 10-year track of substantial, predictable long-term funding, closing what has been called the âRomanow Gap.â The Plan creates a Wait Times Reduction Fund, so that Canadians can see tangible progress in key areas such as cancer and heart treatment, diagnostic imaging, joint replacements and sight restoration."
38th,1st,"The Plan addresses the unique challenges facing the delivery of health care services in Canadaâs North, including the costs of medical transportation, and encourages innovative delivery of services to rural Canada."
38th,1st,"As part of the Plan, governments will, for the first time, set goals and targets for improving the health status of Canadians. The Health Council of Canada will provide an annual report on health status and health outcomes, and will report on progress in implementing the Plan."
38th,1st,Funding arrangements will require that jurisdictions comply with the reporting provisions agreed to by First Ministers.
38th,1st,"Better health for Canadians requires more than just timely access to health care. It requires the promotion of healthy living, addressing risk factors such as physical inactivity and nutrition; the prevention of injury; and integrated disease strategies. The Government will also work with partners to enhance sports activities at both the community and competitive levels."
38th,1st,"The Government has already appointed a new Chief Public Health Officer for Canada to drive real change. The Government will also proceed with new health protection legislation. And it welcomes the development of the Pan-Canadian Public Health Network, which will strengthen collaboration among public health organizations nationwide. The Network will build capacity and provide coordinated responses to infectious disease outbreaks and other public health emergencies."
38th,1st,"CHILDREN, CAREGIVERS AND SENIORS"
38th,1st,"For a decade, all governments have understood that the most important investment that can be made is in our children. That is why, even when it was fighting the deficit, the Government established the National Child Benefitâthe most significant national social program since Medicare."
38th,1st,"There is more that must be done to help families help their children. Parents must have real choices; children must have real opportunities to learn. The time has come for a truly national system of early learning and child care, a system based on the four key principles that parents and child care experts say matterâquality, universality, accessibility and development."
38th,1st,"The Government will put the foundations in place with its provincial and territorial partners, charting a national course that focuses on results, builds on best practices and reports on progress to Canadians. Within this national framework, the provinces and territories will have the flexibility to address their own particular needs and circumstances."
38th,1st,"As our society ages, Canadian families are caring not only for young children but increasingly for elderly spouses and grandparents as well."
38th,1st,"The Government recognizes the vital role of Canadians who care for aged or infirm relatives or those with severe disabilities. It will improve its existing tax-based support and will ask Parliament to consult across the country on additional initiatives. Building on previous measures, the Government will assist people with disabilities in becoming more self-reliant by drawing on the upcoming recommendations of the Technical Advisory Committee on Tax Measures for Persons with Disabilities."
38th,1st,"Canadaâs seniors are healthier and living longer than ever before. Many want to remain active and engaged in community life. To help them, the Government has announced the New Horizons program and will explore other means of ensuring that we do not lose the talents and contribution that seniors can make to our society."
38th,1st,"Canadaâs seniors have earned the right to be treated with dignity. As one step, the Government will increase the Guaranteed Income Supplement for Canadaâs least well-off seniors."
38th,1st,ABORIGINAL CANADIANS
38th,1st,"We must do more to ensure that Canadaâs prosperity is shared by Canadaâs Aboriginal peopleâFirst Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis. We have made progress, but it is overshadowed by the rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and teen suicide in Aboriginal communities. These are the intolerable consequences of the yawning gaps that separate so many Aboriginal people from other Canadiansâunacceptable gaps in education attainment, in employment, in basics like housing and clean water, and in the incidence of chronic diseases such as diabetes."
38th,1st,The Canada-Aboriginal Peoples Roundtable held last April was a major step along a new path of partnership and prosperity. The Government and Aboriginal leaders agreed to measurable goals to reduce these gaps and their consequences.
38th,1st,What could be more profound than targeting real change in the rate of fetal alcohol syndrome and teen suicide?
38th,1st,"At their meeting on September 13 of this year, all First Ministers and Aboriginal leaders took action. There, this Government undertook to provide $700 million to encourage greater Aboriginal participation in the health professions, to address chronic diseases such as diabetes, and to create an Aboriginal Health Transition Fund to better adapt existing health care services to Aboriginal needs."
38th,1st,"The Government is working together with Aboriginal Canadians and provincial and territorial governments to create the conditions for long-term developmentâlearning, economic opportunity, and modern institutions of Aboriginal governanceâwhile respecting historical rights and agreements."
38th,1st,The Government and Aboriginal people will together develop specific quality-of-life indicators and a âReport Cardâ to hold all to account and to drive progress.
38th,1st,CANADAâS CITIES AND COMMUNITIES
38th,1st,"Canadians want their communities, towns and cities to be great places to liveâsafe, with affordable housing, good public transit, clean air and water, and abundant green spaces. Communities are key to our social goals and our economic competitiveness. They are the front lines in building a better quality of life."
38th,1st,"Through the New Deal for Canadaâs Cities and Communities, and working with the provinces and territories, the Government will make available, for the benefit of municipalities, a portion of the federal gas tax, growing over the next five years. These funds will enable municipalities to make long-term financial commitments needed to help contain urban sprawl and to invest in new sustainable infrastructure projects in areas like transit, roads, clean water and sewers."
38th,1st,"To address key issues such as urban renewal, immigrant integration and the challenges facing off-reserve Aboriginal Canadians, the Government will expand the partnership approach used to develop the Vancouver and Winnipeg Agreements and proceed to implement its recent agreement with the Government of Ontario to cooperate in service delivery. The Government will also build on the work of the Harcourt Advisory Committee."
38th,1st,"Shelter is the foundation upon which healthy communities and individual dignity are built. The Government will extend and enhance existing programs such as the Affordable Housing Initiative, the Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative for the homeless, and the Residential Rehabilitation Assistance Program."
38th,1st,"What makes our communities strong is the willingness of men and women from all walks of life to take responsibility for their future and for one another. We can see this in the number of voluntary organizations and social economy enterprises that are finding local solutions to local problems. The Government is determined to foster the social economyâthe myriad not-for-profit activities and enterprises that harness civic and entrepreneurial energies for community benefit right across Canada. The Government will help to create the conditions for their success, including the business environment within which they work. To that end, it will introduce a new Not-for-Profit Corporations Act."
38th,1st,"What makes our communities work is our deep commitment to human rights and mutual respect. The Government is committed to these values. It will modernize Canadaâs Citizenship Act to reaffirm the responsibilities and rights of Canadian citizenship and our values of multiculturalism, gender equality and linguistic duality. It is implementing the Official Languages Action Plan and will continue to promote the vitality of official language minority communities. It will take measures to strengthen Canadaâs ability to combat racism, hate speech and hate crimes, both here at home and around the world. And it will table legislation to protect against trafficking in persons and to crack down on child pornography."
38th,1st,"What makes our communities vibrant and creative is the quality of their cultural life. The Government will foster cultural institutions and policies that aspire to excellence, reflect a diverse and multicultural society, respond to the new challenges of globalization and the digital economy, and promote diversity of views and cultural expression at home and abroad."
38th,1st,OUR ENVIRONMENT
38th,1st,"Our quality of life today, and the legacy we bequeath to future generations, demands fundamental change in the way in which we think about the environment."
38th,1st,The Government will work with its partners to build sustainable development systematically into decision making.
38th,1st,"As the ethic and imperative of sustainability take deeper root worldwide, human ingenuity will turn increasingly to ways to produce and use energy more cleanly and efficiently; to eliminate toxins from our air, water and soil; and to build more sustainable communities. Here lie great new opportunities for the world economy. Canadaâs entrepreneurs must aim to be at the leading edge."
38th,1st,"To that end, the Government will work with the private sector to improve the commercialization of the best new environmental technologies. Major investments funded out of the proceeds of the sale of the Governmentâs Petro-Canada shares will support their development and deployment."
38th,1st,"The Government will work to get its own house in order. It will consolidate federal environmental assessments and will work with the provinces and territories toward a unified and more effective assessment process for Canada. By 2006, the Government will implement a new Green Procurement Policy to govern its purchases. It will also introduce legislation that will strengthen the focus on the ecological integrity of Canadaâs national parks."
38th,1st,"Nowhere are the challenges and opportunities of sustainability more evident than in the way in which we use and produce energy. The Government will place increased focus on energy efficiency and energy research and development. It will engage stakeholders in developing comprehensive approaches to encourage increased production and use of clean, renewable energy and to promote greater energy efficiency. This will build on efforts already underway, including support for wind-power production in Canada, stimulated by a quadrupling of the Wind Power Production Incentive."
38th,1st,"The Government reiterates that it will respect its commitment to the Kyoto Accord on climate change in a way that produces long-term and enduring results while maintaining a strong and growing economy. It will do so by refining and implementing an equitable national plan, in partnership with provincial and territorial governments and other stakeholders."
38th,1st,"As the Government builds a sustainable society at home, it will continue to pursue multilateral and bilateral approaches to what are ultimately global challenges. For example, it will work with the United States and agencies like the International Joint Commission on issues such as clean air, clean water and invasive species. In 2005, the Government will bring forward the next generation of its Great Lakes and St. Lawrence programs, underscoring its commitment to protect and preserve these internationally significant shared ecosystems."
38th,1st,"The Government will also move forward on its Oceans Action Plan by maximizing the use and development of oceans technology, establishing a network of marine protected areas, implementing integrated management plans, and enhancing the enforcement of rules governing oceans and fisheries, including rules governing straddling stocks."
38th,1st,A ROLE OF PRIDE AND INFLUENCE IN THE WORLD
38th,1st,"In todayâs world, effective international engagement is needed to advance national aspirations. Now that time and distance have lost their isolating effect, it is no longer possible to separate domestic and international policies. Canadaâs internationalism is a real advantage, but we must find new ways to express it if we are to effectively assert our interests and project our values in a changing world."
38th,1st,"Just as Canadaâs domestic and international policies must work in concert, so too must our defence, diplomacy, development and trade efforts work in concert. This fall, the Government will release a comprehensive International Policy Statement that will reflect this integration. Parliamentarians and other Canadians will have the opportunity to debate its analyses and proposed directions."
38th,1st,"Meanwhile, the world does not wait. The new security threats that face Canada demand new approaches immediately. The Government has already responded. In April of this year, it introduced Canadaâs first-ever comprehensive National Security Policy, which will ensure a more focused and integrated approach to securing our open society. The Government is now implementing this policy. In this context, the Government is also deepening cooperation with the United States on mutual assistance in the event of major natural or human-caused emergencies."
38th,1st,"This new context requires us to manage wisely our relationship with the United States, to know our friend better, and to strengthen our economic and security relations. Our relationship must be built on shared values, on mutual respect, and on a strong and independent voice for Canada."
38th,1st,"Enhancing Canadaâs security means that we have to invest more in our military as part of defending ourselves at home, in North America and in the world. We have to earn our way in the world. But ours will never be the biggest military force, so it must be smart, strategic and focused."
38th,1st,"Canadaâs proud tradition as a leader in peacekeeping is being tested today by increasing demands in extremely dangerous and politically complicated situations, often involving failed and failing states. We have seen what extraordinary work Canadian men and women can do in places like Afghanistan, Bosnia and Haiti. We know that Canadians are among the best in the world in meeting the challenge of being soldiers to make the peace, diplomats to negotiate the peace and aid workers to nurture the peace."
38th,1st,"That is why the Government will be increasing our regular forces by some 5,000 troops and our reserves by 3,000 so that they may be better prepared and equipped to meet these challenges."
38th,1st,"As Darfur and other situations have shown, sometimes intervention is best achieved by regional forces attuned to their cultural and geographic conditions. In such cases, particularly in Africa, Canada intends to continue playing a role by training regional peacekeepers, to prepare them to conduct challenging security operations within the principles of international humanitarian law."
38th,1st,"In so many of the worldâs trouble spots, establishing order is only the first step. Poverty, despair and violence are usually rooted in failed institutions of basic governance and rule of law. This is where Canada, with its commitment to pluralism and human rights, can make a unique contribution."
38th,1st,"That is why the Government is establishing the Canada Corps. Its mandate is first, to put our idealism to work by helping young Canadians bring their enthusiasm and energy to the world; second, to bring our skills and ideas to bear by ensuring that experts of all ages and backgroundsâfor example, in governance, health, economics, human rightsâcan get to the places in the world that need them; and third, to coordinate the efforts of government and to work with civil society. The Canada Corps will bring the best of Canadian values and experience to the world."
38th,1st,"For all that we as Canadians want to achieve, and for all that we want for others, we also need international institutions that work. Dealing with complex issues like the âresponsibility to protectâ and managing the global commons will require leadership from all continentsâfrom North and South. For that reason, the Government will work to bring about a meeting of G20 leaders to address common and pressing concerns, such as how to improve public health systems, combat terrorism and reform our multilateral institutions."
38th,1st,GOVERNING IN COMMON PURPOSE
38th,1st,The Governmentâs agenda for this Parliament is based on a comprehensive strategy to build a prosperous and sustainable 21st-century economy for Canada; strengthen the countryâs social foundations; and secure for Canada a place of pride and influence in the world.
38th,1st,"Supported by a committed and excellent public service, the Government will work diligently in this minority Parliament to address the priority areas it has identified. It will also introduce initiatives in many other areas, including commitments from the last Speech from the Throne, and will build on the work of Parliamentary committees, involve parliamentarians in the review of key appointments, and examine the need and options for reform of our democratic institutions, including electoral reform."
38th,1st,"The Government invites members from both Chambers to join with it in the same democratic spirit: committed to unity and the inclusion of all regions and all voices, ready to work in common purpose on behalf of Canada."
38th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
38th,1st,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
38th,1st,Honourable Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Commons:
38th,1st,"As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
38th,1st,Stay Connected
37th,1st,"Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and Gentlemen:"
37th,1st,"It is my great pleasure to greet you on this first day of the 37th Parliament since Confederation. The vital relationship that exists between the Canadian people and Parliament is what we celebrate today through history, custom and symbolism."
37th,1st,"I also have the pleasure of welcoming new members to the House of Commons, and I want all parliamentarians to know how deeply I appreciate the ideals that motivate you to serve your country. I also appreciate the sacrifices brought on by your task and made in the name of the common good and of leadership. And in a healthy democracy, leadership can come from everyone, because it is a sense of really knowing what you want and what you can contribute."
37th,1st,"A little more than a year ago, I became Canadaâs 26th Governor General. IÂ set out as the main objective of my first year in office to visit every province and territory and to meet as many Canadians as possible, wherever they live and make their lives â to engage in a true dialogue with them. I have seen many places that Canadians have decided to call home, from big cities to small hamlets, from the Island of Montreal to Ellesmere Island."
37th,1st,"But what we call home is more than a place name on a map. It is our belonging to a community of ideas and ideals; it is the knowledge that we can say something and be listened to, and the conviction that we can respect, rely upon and help each other."
37th,1st,"Meeting Canadians across the country has given me the opportunity to hear about the different challenges we face. Looking at these issues, we of course remember that we have demonstrated, time and time again, that we have the self-confidence to act, and to act successfully. Change does not frighten us â we have always harnessed it to our advantage."
37th,1st,"It is often said that our countryâs strength lies in its diversity. Why is this so? Because diversity imposes serious responsibilities. Indeed, if we accept our place in a rich and successful society, we must also acknowledge and engage with the parts of our society that are less advantaged."
37th,1st,"The Government has been given a third mandate by Canadians. In leading Canada into the new millennium, itsÂ overarching goal will continue to be to build a stronger, ever more inclusive Canada and secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. In pursuing this aim, the Government will carry out the commitments set out in its election platform."
37th,1st,"Canada is proud, optimistic and strong. The Government has achieved the critical objective of restoring the nationâs finances. TheÂ economy continues its longest period of economic expansion since the 1960s. Inflation andÂ interest rates are low and stable. More than two million new jobs have been created since 1993. Significant new investments are being made in children and youth, in innovation and skills, in health care, and in the environment."
37th,1st,"As we enter this new century, Canada and Canadians face the challenges of competing in a faster-paced, technology-driven world economy. Of responding to economic uncertainty among our trading partners. OfÂ continuing toÂ strengthen theÂ fabric of our society in an era of increasing globalization. And of advancing our Canadian interests and values in the international arena."
37th,1st,"We must ensure that every region, every province and territory, every community, and every citizen has a strong voice and can contribute to building our nation. ToÂ bring the benefits of our prosperity to all communities, whether urban, rural, Northern or remote. To promote innovation, growth and development inÂ all parts ofÂ our economy, including our agricultural and resource sectors and our manufacturing and service industries."
37th,1st,"Canadians must rise to these challenges. Success in our more interdependent and complex world will require the contribution of all Canadians. The Government of Canada, for its part, will focus on:"
37th,1st,"In fulfilling itsÂ responsibilities, the Government of Canada will be guided by the values of Canadians. It willÂ workÂ with other levels of government, the private andÂ voluntary sectors, and individual citizens."
37th,1st,"It will continue to set bold goals and work toward them in a pragmatic, step-by-step way. It willÂ continue to be a prudent steward ofÂ the nationâs finances as it focusses on theÂ priorities of Canadians. Its efforts will be affordable and sustainable. The Government reaffirms its commitment to balanced budgets."
37th,1st,"To assist the Government in fulfilling its responsibilities, Canada must have a public service distinguished by excellence and equipped with the skills forÂ a knowledge economy and society. TheÂ Government will seek bright, motivated young women and men to accept the challenge of serving their country in the federal public service. The Government is committed to the reforms needed forÂ the Public Service of Canada to continue evolving and adapting. These reforms will ensure that the Public Service is innovative, dynamic and reflective of the diversity of the country â able to attract and develop the talent needed to serve Canadians in the 21st century."
37th,1st,The Government will help to create opportunity for Canadians and ensure that opportunity is shared by all. This is the Canadian Way for the 21st century.
37th,1st,An innovative economy is essential to creating opportunity for Canadians.
37th,1st,An innovative economy is driven by research and development. It requires aÂ highly skilled work force and investments in new technology. A business environment and tax policies that encourage smart risk taking and entrepreneurship and that reward success. An attractive environment for investment. And a strong global brand for Canadian excellence.
37th,1st,"An innovative economy is one where the benefits of new ideas are shared by every sector and every region â from East to West to North, from office workers to farm families."
37th,1st,"Canada has laid a solid foundation for success in the new economy. Our economic fundamentals are among the best in the world. Spiralling debt and deficits have been replaced by social and economic investments, tax cuts and debt repayments. On January 1st of this year, most elements of the Governmentâs comprehensive and broad-based package of $100 billion in tax relief took effect."
37th,1st,We are better positioned than at any time in the last three decades to seize the opportunities of the global economy and to weather a short-term slowing of growth experienced by Canadaâs major trading partners.
37th,1st,Innovation
37th,1st,"ToÂ secure our continued success in the 21st century, Canadians must be among the first toÂ generate new knowledge and put it to use."
37th,1st,"Our objective should be no less than to be recognized as one of theÂ most innovative countries in the world. Achieving this will require a comprehensive approach and the supportÂ and participation of all governments, businesses, educational institutions, and individualÂ Canadians."
37th,1st,"We mustÂ strive for Canada to become one of the top fiveÂ countries for research and development performance by 2010. This is a challenge for all Canadians, but in particular for the private sector as the largest research investor in Canada."
37th,1st,"As its contribution, the Government will at least double the current federal investment inÂ research and development by 2010. In making new investments, the Government will:"
37th,1st,"New federal investments will include strategically targetted research that isÂ co-ordinated with partners. These investments will directly benefit Canadians in areas such as health, water quality, the environment, natural resources management, and oceans research. Among itsÂ investments, theÂ Government will increaseÂ support for the development of new technologies toÂ assist Canadians with disabilities."
37th,1st,"Research in life sciences will benefit all of Canada, particularly our agricultural and rural economies. The Government will help Canadaâs agricultural sector move beyond crisis management â leading to more genuine diversification and value-added growth, newÂ investments and employment, better land use, and high standards of environmental stewardship and food safety."
37th,1st,Skills and Learning
37th,1st,Canada will only realize its full potential by investing aggressively in the skills and talents of its people.
37th,1st,"To succeed in the knowledge economy, Canada will need people with advanced skills and entrepreneurial spirit. Canadaâs youth are optimistic, technologically savvy, globally connected and the most highly educated generation in our history. The Government will continue to help young Canadians contribute to their country, gain employment, and apply their business and creative skills."
37th,1st,"Building a skilled work force must be a national effort. The Government of Canada will work with provinces and territories and with non-governmental organizations to ensure that all Canadians, young and old, can achieve their learning goals. Canada must see at least one million more adults pursue learning opportunities during the next five years."
37th,1st,"The Government will also help adults who want to improve their skills, but who may face difficulty in finding the time or resources to do this while providing for themselves andÂ their families. It will create Registered Individual Learning Accounts to make it easier for Canadians to finance their learning. And it will improve the loans that are available to part-time students, so more workers can learn while they earn."
37th,1st,Some Canadians face particular challenges in upgrading their skills and enhancing their education. The Government will take steps to make it easier for them to access skills and learning.
37th,1st,Immigrants have enriched Canada with their ideas and talents. The Government will take steps to help Canada attract the skilled workers it needs. ItÂ will also work in co-operation with the provinces and territories to secure better recognition ofÂ the foreign credentials of new Canadians and their more rapid integration into society. The Government will re-introduce changes to immigration legislation to streamline and improve the immigration system.
37th,1st,Connecting Canadians
37th,1st,"The Government has helped toÂ make Canada one of the most connected countries in the world, yet the speed ofÂ change continues to accelerate. Canada must continue to develop and strengthen its information infrastructure."
37th,1st,"The private sector today is expanding high-speed access to the Internet in many regions. The National Broadband Task Force will advise the Government on howÂ Canadians together can achieve the critical goal of making broadband access widely available toÂ citizens, businesses, public institutions and to all communities in Canada by 2004."
37th,1st,"The Government will continue to support the Community Access Program and SchoolNet, ensuring that Canadians, their communities and their schools can have an on-ramp to the information highway. These programs are critical to Canadaâs effort to close the digital divide, particularly in rural, remote, Northern and Aboriginal communities. The Government will also enhance SchoolNet, focussing on creating more and better learning content on-line."
37th,1st,"The Government will continue to work toward putting its services on-line byÂ 2004, to better connect with citizens."
37th,1st,It will also modernize federal privacy law toÂ safeguard the personal information of Canadians and provide better copyright protection for new ideas and knowledge.
37th,1st,Trade and Investment
37th,1st,"The Governmentâs investments in innovation, skills and connectivity, as well as its reduction of corporate taxes and improved treatment of capital gains, areÂ making Canada one of the most attractive places to invest and to do business. In addition, the Government will:"
37th,1st,"The Government will work closely with the United States, Canadaâs most important trading partner, to maintain secure and efficient access to each otherâs markets. It will continue the joint work begun to modernize the shared border."
37th,1st,"At the Third Summit of the Americas in Quebec City this April, the Government will advance work toward creating the Free Trade Area ofÂ the Americas."
37th,1st,"The Government will also launch a branding strategy to raise awareness of the advantages of investing in Canada. As part of this effort, the Government will continue its successful Team Canada trade missions and launch Investment Team Canada missions to the United States and Europe."
37th,1st,The Canadian Way recognizes that economic and social success must be pursued together. We cannot build aÂ prosperous society in the absence of economic growth. We cannot lead in innovation and new ideas without healthy and secure citizens. We must not pursue our interests in the world without strengthening our distinct culture and values here at home.
37th,1st,"Nowhere is the creation and sharing of opportunity more important than for Aboriginal people. Too many continue to live in poverty, without the tools they need to build a better future for themselves or their communities. As a country, we must be direct about the magnitude of the challenge and ambitious in our commitment to tackle the most pressing problems facing Aboriginal people. Reaching our objectives will take time, but we must not be deterred by the length of the journey or the obstacles that we may encounter along the way."
37th,1st,"The Government is committed to strengthening its relationship with Aboriginal people. It will support First Nations communities inÂ strengthening governance, including implementing more effective and transparent administrative practices. And it willÂ work to ensure that basic needs are met for jobs, health, education, housing and infrastructure. This commitment will be reflected in all the Governmentâs priorities."
37th,1st,Children and Families
37th,1st,"Securing a good start in life for children is the only way to ensure that they are ready toÂ learn, to seize opportunity as adults, and to contribute to the building of their country."
37th,1st,"There was a time in Canada when retirement often meant facing a new lifeÂ of hardship. A generation ago, Canadians set a national goal to eliminate poverty among seniors, and we have made significant progress."
37th,1st,"There was a time in this country when falling sick meant risking oneâs life savings. Working together, Canadians built a national, publicly funded health care system to ensure access to quality care for every citizen regardless of income."
37th,1st,There was a time when losing a job also meant immediate loss of income for workers and their families. And so Canadians created Employment Insurance.
37th,1st,Now Canadians must undertake another national project â to ensure that no Canadian child suffers the debilitating effects of poverty.
37th,1st,Canadians and their governments have already taken significant steps in this direction.
37th,1st,A strong economy and job creation have been essential to reducing poverty and ensuring that families have the resources to care forÂ their children. But economic growth alone is not enough. Governments also have a key role to play in helping families left behind and in providing support to families and children.
37th,1st,All governments have put in place a range of measures to help families and children. The National Child Benefit is the cornerstone of our collective efforts to provide children with a better start. It is the single most important social program to be introduced in this country since medicare in the 1960s. The Government of Canadaâs contribution to the National Child Benefit will continue to rise over the next four years.
37th,1st,"Most recently, the Government of Canada and provinces and territories launched the EarlyÂ Childhood Development initiative to expand and improve access to services for all families and children. The Government of CanadaÂ is investing more than $2 billion in this initiative over five years. As part of this agreement, governments will begin reporting to Canadians on the outcomes of their programs and services for children. These reports will give the Government of Canada and its partners the information they need to take whatever additional steps are necessary to provide Canadian children with a better start in life."
37th,1st,The Government of Canada will also take immediate action with its partners where the challenges are greatest.
37th,1st,Good Health and Quality Care
37th,1st,A healthy Canadian society is built on the health and well-being of individual Canadians and the health of our communities.
37th,1st,"Canadians place a high priority on good health and on their health care system. We know that our system of medicare, which ensures access to needed services regardless of income or place of residence, is vital to our quality of life. ItÂ is a Canadian advantage and deeply valued by all citizens."
37th,1st,The Government of Canada will uphold the Canada Health Act. It will work with the provinces and territories to ensure that all governments continue to fulfil their commitment to the principles of medicare.
37th,1st,"Governments in Canada haveÂ come together to strengthen and renew Canadaâs health care system. Last September, First Ministers affirmed the commitment of their governments to the principles of the Canada Health Act and endorsed a health action plan that will enable them to move forward in building a modern, integrated and sustainable health system for Canadians."
37th,1st,"Over the next three years, governments will take concrete action to reform and support innovation in primary care, to adopt modern healthÂ information technologies, and to purchase needed diagnostic andÂ medical equipment. For itsÂ part, theÂ Government of Canada is committing more than $21Â billion in new funding to the provinces and territories over five years through the Canada Health and Social Transfer."
37th,1st,The Government will also champion community-based health promotion and disease prevention measures.
37th,1st,"Building on the health action planâs commitment to public reporting, the Government of Canada will work with the provinces and territories to create a citizensâ council on health care quality. This council will ensure that the publicâs perspective is considered in developing meaningful indicators of health system performance."
37th,1st,"As public reporting begins on how the health system is meeting the needsÂ of Canadians, governments will use this information to continue to move forward with the renewal of medicare."
37th,1st,A Clean Environment
37th,1st,Canada is blessed by the beauty of its vast landscape and the wealth of its natural resources. But with this blessing comes the responsibility to ensure its preservation. A healthy environment is an essential part of a sustainable economy and our quality of life.
37th,1st,"The Governmentâs focus will be on the threeÂ priorities of clean air, clean water, and the conservation of Canadaâs natural spaces."
37th,1st,"Last December, the Government of Canada signed an agreement with the United States to significantly reduce the emissions that cause smog. This agreement will lead toÂ aÂ 90 percent reduction in smog-causing vehicle emissions by 2010, bringing cleaner air to millions of citizens in both countries. The Government will move quickly toÂ implement this agreement and other measures, working with the provinces and territories to achieveÂ cleaner air.Â "
37th,1st,"ItÂ is Canadaâs responsibility, as steward of one of the worldâs largest supplies of fresh water, to protect this critical resource. Safeguarding our water is a shared task among governments, industry and individual Canadians. The Government of Canada will fulfil its direct responsibilities for water, including the safety of water supplies on reserves and federal lands."
37th,1st,"Canadians are the guardians of a significant percentage of the worldâs wilderness and wildlife. The Government will invest in the creation of new national parks and implement aÂ plan to restore existing parks to ecological health. It will work with its partners toward more integrated, sustainable management of Canadaâs oceans. And it will re-introduce legislation for marine conservation areas and to protect species at risk."
37th,1st,"As part of its efforts to promote global sustainable development, the Government will ensure that Canada does its part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will work with its provincial and territorialÂ partners to implement the recently announced first national business plan on climate change."
37th,1st,"To safeguard Canadians from toxic substances and environmental contaminants, the Government will also strengthen laws, research efforts and other measures for health protection. This will include the development of appropriate standards that reflect the special vulnerabilities of children."
37th,1st,Strong and Safe Communities
37th,1st,Strong and safe communities are an essential part of the fabric of our society. They are critical to providing Canadians with the security to build a better future for themselves and their families. They are also important to attracting talented people from aroundÂ the world to come and make their home here.
37th,1st,"Canadian communities of all sizes â whether urban or rural, Aboriginal or multicultural â face diverse challenges and have unique needs. The Government of Canada will strive to ensure that, wherever possible, its actions and programs are co-ordinated to help build local solutions to local challenges. ItÂ will workÂ with partners across Canada to launch a dialogue on the opportunities and challenges facing urban centres. It will co-operate with provincial and municipal partners to help improve public transit infrastructure. And it will help to stimulate the creation of more affordable rental housing."
37th,1st,Ensuring that Canadaâs communities are safe is an important element of fostering and attracting the talented people needed for success in the new economy. Crime rates in Canada have fallen steadily for almost a decade.
37th,1st,"The Government of Canada will continue to work with provinces and territories, communities, and all its partners to implement a balanced approachÂ to addressing crime âÂ focussing on prevention as much asÂ punishment, strengthening penalties for serious crime, and considering the needs of victims."
37th,1st,"The Government will focus on safeguarding Canadians from new and emerging forms of crime. It willÂ take aggressive steps to combat organized crime, including the creation of stronger anti-gang laws and measures to protect members of the justice system from intimidation. It will provide enhanced law enforcement tools to deal with emerging threats to security, such as cybercrime and terrorism. It will act to safeguard children from crime, including criminals on the Internet. The Government will take steps to ensure that our laws protect children from those who would prey on their vulnerability."
37th,1st,"The Government will re-introduce legislation to change how the justice system deals with youngÂ offenders. It will encourage alternatives to custody for non-violent offenders, emphasizing rehabilitation and re-integration into society, while toughening consequences for more violent youth."
37th,1st,"Working with the provinces, territories and communities, the Government of Canada will strengthen the capacity of local communities to deal with conflict, prevent crime, and address drug abuse."
37th,1st,"It is a tragic reality that too many Aboriginal people are finding themselves in conflict with the law. Canada must take the measures needed to significantly reduce the percentage of Aboriginal people entering theÂ criminal justice system, so that within a generation it is no higher than the Canadian average."
37th,1st,Â 
37th,1st,Vibrant Canadian Culture
37th,1st,Â 
37th,1st,"Canada is defined by far more than its political boundaries or economic relationships. In these times of rapid change and globalization, it is more important than ever that we know who we are as Canadians and what brings us together."
37th,1st,"The focus of our cultural policies for the future must be on excellence in the creative process, diverse Canadian content, and access to the arts and heritage for all Canadians."
37th,1st,"Both the English and French networks of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation have long been cornerstones of Canadian cultural policy. The CBC helps connect Canadians to each other, their history and their country. It reaches all parts of Canada, from big cities to small towns to Northern and Aboriginal communities. It provides a distinctive Canadian voice in both official languages and important opportunities for our creative people. The Government will increase its support to help the CBC fulfil its distinct role asÂ a public broadcaster serving all Canadians."
37th,1st,The Government will assist the book-publishing and sound-recording sectors to make the transition to the new economy. It will continue to support the development ofÂ digital content for the Internet and other new media in French and English. AndÂ itÂ will work to expand international markets for Canadian cultural products and services.
37th,1st,"Communities across Canada are increasingly recognizing the importance of arts and heritage for their quality of life and ability to attract talent, investment and tourism. The Government of Canada will continue to work with the private and not-for-profit sectors and other governments to strengthen Canadaâs cultural infrastructure. It will help communities to develop arts and heritage programs that are sustainable and relevant to their diverse circumstances and aspirations."
37th,1st,"The well-being of Canada and Canadians depends on global human security, prosperity and development."
37th,1st,The Government of Canada is committed to working with its international partners to promote international peace and security by enhancing the mechanisms for conflict prevention and resolution. It will work to strengthen global governance as well as existing and new multilateral institutions. These include the G-20 â a new forum of which Canada is the first chair â which is striving to enhance the stability of the world economy and ensure that globalization benefits all its participants.
37th,1st,"The Government will increase Canadaâs official development assistance and use these new investments to advance efforts to reduce international poverty and to strengthen democracy, justice and social stability worldwide."
37th,1st,"Canadians have become leaders in harnessing the power of technology toÂ build a more inclusive society. This experience serves asÂ a powerful model forÂ the world. Through itsÂ participation on the Digital Opportunities TaskÂ Force established by the G-8 nations and through its own investments in developing countries, Canada will contribute to closing the global digital divide."
37th,1st,"The Government will continue Canadaâs proud record of peacekeeping. InÂ Budget 2000, the Government provided funding increases for the Canadian Forces to help ensure that they are equipped and prepared to respond quickly to calls for help atÂ home and abroad."
37th,1st,"The Summit of the Americas this year presents an exceptional opportunity to promote a balanced and coherent vision for deepening co-operation among the nations of the Western hemisphere. The summit declaration and action plan will support Canadaâs interest in strengthening democracy and human rights, expanding commerce through the Free Trade Area of the Americas initiative, increasing peopleâs access to the benefits of growth, and providing opportunities for all nations in the Americas to improve the quality of life of their citizens."
37th,1st,"At the Summit of the Americas and as chair of the G-8 in 2002, Canada will work to expand opportunities for more countries to participate in the benefits of globalization, while pressing for peace and security in the world."
37th,1st,Canada was born of a noble vision and an act of will.
37th,1st,Our Canadian citizenship has been built over time through the experiences we have shared . . .
37th,1st,". . . when together we celebrate the successes of our scientists, scholars, athletes and artists, our leaders on the world stage, and our peacekeepers. And when we remember and honour our war veterans."
37th,1st,. . . when we visit other parts of our country or when we travel abroad and seeÂ ourselves through the eyes of others.
37th,1st,. . . whenÂ every year thousands of new Canadians stand proudly with their families to take on the responsibilities of Canadian citizenship.
37th,1st,. . . when we come together to help each other in tough times. And when millions of Canadians volunteer their time and energy to make their communities a better place.
37th,1st,"The Government will help Canadians to strengthen their bonds of mutual understanding and respect, to celebrate their achievements and history, and to exercise their shared citizenship."
37th,1st,"The institutions of Government will continue to be strengthened. Since 1993, the Government has taken a range of measures to enable members of Parliament to more effectively represent the views of their constituents. MPs have participated in pre-budget consultations, at the end of which recommendations were made to the Government. Moreover, privateÂ membersâ bills from the House and Senate have been taken into account more often and considered with greater attention than at any time in the past."
37th,1st,"In this new session of Parliament, the Government will make further proposals to improve procedures in the House and Senate. Among other measures, voting procedures will be modernized in the House of Commons and, to assist parliamentarians in carryingÂ out their duties, the Government intends toÂ increase the resources of the Library of Parliament to better serve the research needs of standing committees of the House and Senate."
37th,1st,Every Canadian is called upon to make a contribution to building our country. To ensure that the promise of Canada becomes an even greater reality inÂ the 21stÂ century. And to ensure that our Canadian Way remains the best exampleÂ of what is possible when women and men of every race and creed come together in community in search of a better future.
37th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
37th,1st,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
37th,1st,Honourable Members of the Senate and
37th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
37th,1st,May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
37th,1st,Â 
37th,1st,Stay Connected
37th,2nd,"Honourable Members of the Senate,Members of the House of Commons,Ladies and Gentlemen:"
37th,2nd,"It is a pleasure to greet you in the Jubilee Year of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, whom we will be welcoming to Canada very shortly."
37th,2nd,"We also mark this year the 50th anniversary of Canadian Governors General. To celebrate this, we invited to Rideau Hall an energetic group of one hundred 17- and 18-year-olds from every province and territory to participate in a Youth Forum on creating community. In GaspÃ©, in Nunavut, on Haida Gwaii, all across the country, we are meeting young people who are becoming catalysts for change, as they take their place as leaders in the fields they choose."
37th,2nd,"It is exciting and encouraging to hear what young people are saying and what they are doing. Already, they are innovative. They are diverse. And they will change things. Some of them will do so through journalism, the arts, business or the labour movement. Others will devote themselves to civic and public life, perhaps becoming in time your successors, to carry on the democratic traditions of Parliament to which you are committing your lives. Nothing is more precious and valuable than our way of creating a society through the exercise of our democratic rights as citizens."
37th,2nd,"And the sacrifices that some of our citizens make are deeply appreciated by their country. My trip in April to Germany, where our fallen and injured were brought from the tragic incident in Afghanistan, was emotionally shared by all Canadians, many of whom have expressed how much the sacrifice of these men has meant to them."
37th,2nd,"This kind of contribution, this kind of democratic participation, this kind of nurturing of young leadership make us what we are as a nation. It is a very precious life that we share as Canadians. And we must be prepared not only to praise it, but also to make sacrifices for it."
37th,2nd,"Canadians today are confident about their personal prospects and Canadaâs future. Less than ten years ago, our economy was in decline, our deficit and debt were rising out of control, our unity was under threat, our confidence was shaken."
37th,2nd,"Today, because of our collective efforts, we have new opportunities, new possibilities and new choices for the Canada we want."
37th,2nd,"We have established the foundations for great success: fiscal sovereignty, a unified country and a confident people. We will not put at risk the accomplishments of the last decade. We will continue to be prudent and live within our means."
37th,2nd,"Maintaining our fiscal sovereignty and a dynamic economy allows us to reach higher. To find new solutions to enduring problems. To set new goals and ambitious targets. To take responsibility for building the Canada we want, for ourselves and for future generations."
37th,2nd,"We now have a generation of Canadians who have grown up in the Internet world, a generation of Canadians who are global, at ease with change and diversity, optimistic and eager to create, innovate and excel. And who believe they can achieve their aspirations in Canada. Canada must tap into and unleash this energy."
37th,2nd,The goal of the government is nothing less than making Canada a land of ever-widening opportunity. Ensuring that the benefits of the new economy touch every community and lift every family and every Canadian.
37th,2nd,"Working together, we can put in place the health care system for the 21st century. We can get Canadaâs children off welfare. We can close the gap in life chances between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians. We can tackle the challenge of climate change. We can be a world leader in innovation and learning, a magnet for talent and investment. We can build world-class cities and healthy communities. We can strengthen the bonds of shared citizenship and the partnership between government and Canadians. We can secure our place in North America and in the world as a mature country, confident in who we are and where we are headed."
37th,2nd,This is the time for Canada.
37th,2nd,Canada and the World
37th,2nd,We live in uncertain times. The events of September 11 demonstrated that our progress at home can be affected in a moment by world events. We see unrest in many parts of the world. We still see far too much poverty.
37th,2nd,"The government will continue to work with its allies to ensure the safety and security of Canadians. Canada will continue to work through organizations such as the United Nations to ensure that the rule of international law is respected and enforced. At the same time, the government will remain vigilant and ready to ensure the protection of Canadians from emerging threats, and will work with the United States to address our shared security needs."
37th,2nd,"But there is more we can do. Canada has a long history of contributing solutions to global problems. We will continue to speak out in every forum for the values of pluralism, freedom and democracy, and contribute to reducing the growing global divide between rich and poor. We will double our development assistance by the year 2010, and earmark at least half of that increase for Africa as part of Canadaâs support for the New Partnership for Africaâs Development. As of January 1, 2003, Canada will eliminate tariffs and quotas on almost all products from the least-developed countries."
37th,2nd,"In the face of rapid change and uncertainty, the government must engage Canadians in a discussion about the role that Canada will play in the world. Before the end of this mandate, the government will set out a long-term direction on international and defence policy that reflects our values and interests and ensures that Canadaâs military is equipped to fulfill the demands placed upon it."
37th,2nd,Putting in Place the Health Care System for 21st Century
37th,2nd,No issue touches Canadians more deeply than health care. Our health care system is a practical expression of the values that define us as a country. Of the willingness of Canadians to share risk and accept responsibility for one another.
37th,2nd,"In 2000, all First Ministers reached an agreement on health care that reinforced our collective commitment to the principles of medicare, to working collaboratively to reform our system and to measure and report on our progress. Resources were provided. Work is proceeding. And the first public report is now available."
37th,2nd,"Building on this work, Roy Romanow was appointed to lead a commission on the longer-term future of Canadaâs publicly funded health care system. He will report in November."
37th,2nd,"The Prime Minister will convene a First Ministers Meeting early in 2003 to put in place a comprehensive plan for reform, including enhanced accountability to Canadians and the necessary federal long-term investments, which will be included in the next budget."
37th,2nd,"At the same time, the government will move ahead with an action plan in health policy areas under its direct responsibility. Under this plan, it will renew federal health protection legislation to better address emerging risks, adapt to modern technology and emphasize prevention. The government will take steps to strengthen the security of Canadaâs food system and reintroduce pesticides legislation to protect the health of Canadians, particularly children. It will work with its partners to develop a national strategy for healthy living, physical activity and sport, and will convene the first ever national summit on these issues in 2003. The government will take further action to close the gap in health status between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Canadians by putting in place a First Nations Health Promotion and Disease Prevention strategy with a targeted immunization program, and by working with its partners to improve health care delivery on-reserve."
37th,2nd,"The government will also modify existing programs to ensure that Canadians can provide compassionate care for a gravely ill or dying child, parent or spouse without putting their jobs or incomes at risk."
37th,2nd,Helping Children and Families out of Poverty
37th,2nd,"Five years ago, Canadaâs governments launched the National Childrenâs Agenda, engaging Canadians in every part of the country on how to ensure that all Canadian children have a good start in life; that families with children have the tools they need to provide care and nurturing."
37th,2nd,"No investments have greater payoff. No investments do more to break the cycle of poverty and dependency, and to maximize the potential of every Canadian."
37th,2nd,"The government will put in place a long-term investment plan to allow poor families to break out of the welfare trap so that children born into poverty do not carry the consequences of that poverty throughout their lives. It will again significantly increase the National Child Benefit for poor families, and will work with its partners to increase access to early learning opportunities and to quality child care, particularly for poor and lone-parent families. It will also put in place targeted measures for low-income families caring for severely disabled children, to help meet the needs of the child and of the family."
37th,2nd,"The government will take additional measures to address the gap in life chances between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal children. It will put in place early childhood development programs for First Nations, expanding Aboriginal Headstart, improving parental supports and providing Aboriginal communities with the tools to address fetal alcohol syndrome and its effects. The most enduring contribution Canada can make to First Nations is to raise the standard of education on-reserve. The government will work with the recently created National Working Group on Education to improve educational outcomes for First Nations children, and take immediate steps to help First Nations children with special learning needs."
37th,2nd,"Parents have the primary responsibility for providing their children with the tools to learn and develop. But Canadians also have a collective responsibility to protect Canadaâs children from exploitation in all its forms, and from the consequences of family breakdown."
37th,2nd,"The government will therefore reform the Criminal Code to increase the penalties for abuse and neglect, and provide more sensitive treatment for children who take part in justice proceedings as victims or as witnesses. It will also reform family law, putting greater emphasis on the best interests of the child; expand the Unified Family Courts; and ensure that appropriate child and family services are available."
37th,2nd,The Challenge of Climate Change and the Environment
37th,2nd,"Canadians know that our health and the health of our children, the quality of life in our communities and our continued economic prosperity depend on a healthy environment."
37th,2nd,"On a global scale, the problem of climate change is creating new health and environmental risks and threatens to become the defining challenge for generations to come."
37th,2nd,"As a northern country, Canadians will feel some of the effects of climate change sooner than will others. As a prosperous country, we must and will do our part."
37th,2nd,"As part of the Kyoto Protocol, Canada agreed to obligations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2012. Extensive consultations and preparatory work followed. The government is now intensifying consultations with Canadians, industry and provinces to develop an implementation strategy to meet Canadaâs obligations over the next ten years. Before the end of this year, the government will bring forward a resolution to Parliament on the issue of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol on Climate Change. Meeting this challenge must become a national project, calling upon the efforts and contributions of all Canadians, in all regions and sectors of the economyâproducers and consumers, governments and citizens."
37th,2nd,"To conserve our wilderness areas, clean water sources and key habitat, the government will create ten new national parks and five new National Marine Conservation Areas over the next five years. It will improve the ecological integrity in Canadaâs existing national parks. It will reintroduce legislation to protect species at risk."
37th,2nd,"The government will accelerate the clean-up of federal contaminated sites in Canada. It will work with the United States to further improve air quality. It will accelerate its work with the provinces on improved national water quality guidelines, and ensure their implementation in areas of federal jurisdiction."
37th,2nd,A Magnet for Talent and Investment
37th,2nd,"The Canada we want requires a strong economy. The government will maintain its unwavering commitment to balanced budgets, disciplined spending, a declining ratio of debt-to-GDP, and fair and competitive taxes. It will build on its investments in research, literacy and education, and in competitive cities and healthy communities. It will also adjust its policies to enhance the climate for investment and talent. The government will reallocate resources to the highest priorities and transform old spending to new purposes."
37th,2nd,"Skills, Learning and Research"
37th,2nd,"The fuel of the new economy is knowledge. The government has invested heavily in providing Canadaâs schools and libraries with the information technology to connect young Canadians with the best information and knowledge the world has to offer. It has invested in access to universities and in excellence in university research because Canadaâs youth need and deserve the best education possible, and Canada needs universities that produce the best knowledge and the best graduates."
37th,2nd,The government will build on these investments. It will continue to increase its funding to the federal granting councils to provide young Canadians greater support for graduate studies and research. It will work with universities on the indirect costs of research and on strategies for its commercialization to create opportunities for entrepreneurs and to fuel innovation. It will continue to work with small- and medium-sized enterprises in the development and application of new technologies in traditional and emerging sectors.
37th,2nd,"It will strengthen government science, integrating its efforts across departments and disciplines, and focussing on the priorities of Canadians."
37th,2nd,"In November, the Government of Canada will host the National Summit on Innovation and Learning. This will be an opportunity to position Canada as a world leader in such areas as health sciences, biotechnology and clean energy."
37th,2nd,"The economy of the 21st century will need workers who are lifelong learners, who can respond and adapt to change. Canadaâs labour market programs must be transformed to meet this challenge. To this end, the government will work with Canadians, provinces, sector councils, labour organizations and learning institutions to create the skills and learning architecture that Canada needs, and to promote workplace learning. This will include building our knowledge and reporting to Canadians about what is working and what is not."
37th,2nd,"The Youth Employment Strategy has been successful in increasing job opportunities and experience for young Canadians. But the employment needs of our youth are changing. Government strategies have to keep pace. Working with youth and other partners, the government will redirect its resources in this area to develop skills for the future and to help those who face the greatest barriers to employment. It will also work with the provinces to fast-track a comprehensive agreement to remove barriers to participation in work and learning for persons with disabilities."
37th,2nd,"The government will promote entrepreneurial skills and job creation among Aboriginal people by increasing support for Aboriginal Business Canada. It will also tailor and target its training programs to help Aboriginal and Inuit people participate in economic opportunities such as the development of Voisey Bay, northern gas pipelines and similar projects throughout Canada."
37th,2nd,"One of Canadaâs greatest assetsâand a unique advantage in a globalized worldâis our openness to immigrants from every corner of the globe. The demographic realities of an aging population and slowing labour force growth place an even greater premium on this immigration advantage. Canada must continue to be the country that immigrants choose to find hope, hospitality and opportunity."
37th,2nd,The government will work with its partners to break down the barriers to the recognition of foreign credentials and will fast-track skilled workers entering Canada with jobs already waiting for them. It will also position Canada as a destination of choice for talented foreign students and skilled workers by more aggressively selecting and recruiting through universities and in key embassies abroad.
37th,2nd,Smart Regulation
37th,2nd,"The knowledge economy requires new approaches to how we regulate. We need regulation to achieve the public good, and we need to regulate in a way that enhances the climate for investment and trust in the markets. The government will move forward with a smart regulation strategy to accelerate reforms in key areas to promote health and sustainability, to contribute to innovation and economic growth, and to reduce the administrative burden on business."
37th,2nd,"As part of this strategy, the government will adapt its intellectual property framework to enable Canada to be a world leader on emerging issues such as new life forms. It will speed up the regulatory process for drug approvals to ensure that Canadians have faster access to the safe drugs they need, creating a better climate for research in pharmaceuticals. It will work with provinces to implement a national system for the governance of research involving humans, including national research ethics and standards."
37th,2nd,The government will revise Canadian copyright rules to ensure that Canada has a progressive regime that supports increased investment in knowledge and cultural works.
37th,2nd,"It will reintroduce legislation to amend the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. It will also streamline environmental assessment processes, including implementing a single window for projects such as the northern pipeline. To pursue its strategy over the longer-term, the government will create an External Advisory Committee on Smart Regulation to recommend areas where government needs to redesign its regulatory approach to create and maintain a Canadian advantage."
37th,2nd,"The government will implement the recently announced Agricultural Policy Framework and related measures to promote innovation in that key sector, which is vital to rural Canada and all Canadians."
37th,2nd,"The Canada-US Smart Border Declaration contributes to both our national security and the free flow of people, goods and commerce across our shared border. The government will build on this work and increase its consular presence to expand fair and secure trade and commerce, and to brand Canada in the United States. It will continue to work bilaterally and multilaterally to resolve trade disputes over softwood lumber and agriculture."
37th,2nd,"Recent events in the United States have weakened confidence in capital markets, not only in that country, but around the world. The government has been working closely with all parties to bolster investor confidence and improve the efficiency and integrity of Canadian capital markets. In this regard, it will review and, where necessary, change its laws and strengthen enforcement to ensure that governance standards for federally incorporated companies and financial institutions remain of the highest order."
37th,2nd,"Many investors and businesses have expressed concern that Canadaâs fragmented securities regulatory structure is inadequate and an obstacle to growth. They have urged reform to ensure that businesses can efficiently access the financing they need to grow, and to assure Canadians that they will be treated fairly when they invest. Co-operation among governments will be necessary. The government will work with all participants to ensure that Canada has the modern and efficient securities regulatory system it needs."
37th,2nd,Competitive Cities and Healthy Communities
37th,2nd,"Competitive cities and healthy communities are vital to our individual and national well-being, and to Canadaâs ability to attract and retain talent and investment. They require not only strong industries, but also safe neighbourhoods; not only a dynamic labour force, but access to a rich and diverse cultural life. They require new partnerships, a new urban strategy, a new approach to healthy communities for the 21st century."
37th,2nd,"Modern infrastructure is key to the prosperity of our cities and the health of our communities. Working with provinces and municipalities, the government will put in place a ten-year program for infrastructure to accommodate long-term strategic initiatives essential to competitiveness and sustainable growth. Within this framework, it will introduce a new strategy for a safe, efficient and environmentally responsible transportation system that will help reduce congestion in our cities and bottlenecks in our trade corridors."
37th,2nd,"It will extend its investments in affordable housing for those whose needs are greatest, particularly in those Canadians cities where the problem is most acute. It will extend the Supporting Communities Partnership Initiative to provide communities with the tools to plan and implement local strategies to help reduce homelessness."
37th,2nd,"In a number of cities, poverty is disproportionately concentrated among Aboriginal people. The government will work with interested provinces to expand on existing pilot programs to meet the needs of Aboriginal people living in cities."
37th,2nd,"The government will target its regional development activities to better meet the needs of the knowledge economy and address the distinct challenges of Canadaâs urban, rural and northern communities."
37th,2nd,"The government will work with Canadaâs largest cities to develop targeted strategies to reduce the barriers faced by new immigrants in settling into the social and economic life of their new communities. It will introduce targeted measures to help children of recent immigrants to learn French and English, so that they can realize the opportunities that brought their parents to this country."
37th,2nd,"The government will also implement a national drug strategy to address addiction while promoting public safety. It will expand the number of drug treatment courts. It will act on the results of parliamentary consultations with Canadians on options for change in our drug laws, including the possibility of the decriminalization of marijuana possession."
37th,2nd,A New Partnership Between Government and Citizens
37th,2nd,"Canada has a unique model of citizenship, based simultaneously on diversity and mutual responsibility. This model requires deliberate efforts to connect Canadians across their differences, to link them to their history and to enable their diverse voices to participate in choosing the Canada we want."
37th,2nd,"The government will ensure that as Canadians take charge of their future, they will have access to their history by creating a new institution that brings together the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada, providing new tools to reach Canadians, young and old. It will also strengthen key arts and heritage institutions and protect significant historic sites and buildings."
37th,2nd,"It will create more opportunities for young Canadians to help clean up our environment and assist in achieving Canadaâs global priorities, particularly in Africa."
37th,2nd,It will reform our citizenship legislation to reassert the rights and reinforce the responsibilities that go with being Canadian.
37th,2nd,"It will put into action the accord it signed with the voluntary sector last December, to enable the sector to contribute to national priorities and represent the views of those too often excluded."
37th,2nd,The government will work with provinces toward renewal of legal aid so that Canadians can have access to adequate legal representation before the courts.
37th,2nd,"Linguistic duality is at the heart of our collective identity. The government will implement an action plan on official languages that will focus on minority-language and second-language education, including the goal of doubling within ten years the number of high school graduates with a working knowledge of both English and French. It will support the development of minority English- and French-speaking communities, and expand access to services in their language in areas such as health. It will enhance the use of our two official languages in the federal public service, both in the workplace and when communicating with Canadians."
37th,2nd,"The government will reintroduce legislation to strengthen First Nations governance institutionsâto support democratic principles, transparency and public accountability, and provide the tools to improve the quality of public administration in First Nations communities. It will work with these communities to build their capacity for economic and social development, and it will expand community-based justice approaches, particularly for youth living on reserves and Aboriginals in the North. The government will also work with Aboriginal people to preserve and enhance Aboriginal languages and cultures."
37th,2nd,"Canadians want their government to be open, accountable and responsive to their diverse and changing needs."
37th,2nd,"Early in this session, the government will provide clear guidance and better enforcement of the ethical standards expected of elected officials and senior public servants. The government will strengthen the legislation governing its relationship with lobbyists. And the government will introduce legislative changes to the financing of political parties and candidates for office."
37th,2nd,Canadians know the value and importance of the role of government and of the need for excellence in the public service. The government will introduce long-awaited reforms for the public service to ensure that it can attract the diverse talent it needs to continue to serve Canadians well.
37th,2nd,Conclusion
37th,2nd,The Canada we want cannot happen by government acting alone or by citizens acting apart.
37th,2nd,"We know that by pursuing the common good, we pursue our own good; that a country is more than a collection of narrow interests, it is a common enterprise to which all can contribute."
37th,2nd,"The priorities we have outlined today build on the conviction that we must add to the work of our ancestors, and leave Canada a better place for future generations."
37th,2nd,"May our future, like our past, be a story of achievement."
37th,2nd,Fellow Canadians:
37th,2nd,"Respectful of our history, confident in our future, let each of us do our part."
37th,2nd,Members of the House of Commons:
37th,2nd,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
37th,2nd,Honourable Members of the Senate andMembers of the House of Commons:
37th,2nd,"As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
37th,2nd,Stay Connected
37th,3rd,"Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and Gentlemen:"
37th,3rd,"I am pleased to greet you at the beginning of 2004, when, as Canadians, we know that our history and our capacity for change are a part of our strength as a complex and modern country. Human dignity and respect for others and a realistic awareness of our past make us a mature nation and help us to move forward to express our true values."
37th,3rd,"We have our Canadian values and we can bring them into the international sphere in a humanitarian and effective way. As Governor General and Commander-in-Chief of the Canadian Forces, I have the privilege of seeing our values as Canadians in action."
37th,3rd,"When I visited our troops in Kabul, I could see that our troops play a vital role of courage and commitment. In the past year, we have suffered tragic loss and injury to our soldiers while carrying out Canadaâs commitment to peace. I said to the soldiers that every single one of them carries within him or her a microcosm of our Canadian character. A desire to create a world where fairness, justice and decency reign."
37th,3rd,"That part of the Canadian character comes out in civilian ways when we face natural disastersâsuch as the devastation of the fires in British Columbia or the destruction of Hurricane Juan on our eastern coast. My visit to Kelowna and Kamloops after the devastating fires confirmed to me that Canadians, even in distress and loss, think of others. Many assured me that their situations were not as bad as their neighboursâ and were more concerned about how others would cope."
37th,3rd,"It is this ability to look at the needs of others, to feel compassion for their suffering as part of our own, which speaks to the best of us as Canadians. I think this comes from the fact that we have a society that is caring, in which Aboriginals, Francophones, Anglophonesâand immigrants from all over the worldâplay a significant part. Our history has prepared us to be innovative in the modern world, where diversity counts for so much."
37th,3rd,"I preside over citizenship ceremonies across this country whenever I can, most recently in Saskatoon 10 days ago. But whether itâs in Saint John, Quebec City, Ottawa, Calgary, I speak to our newest Canadians with optimism. Because I know that, as they look around them, they will see examples of what it is like to live the truly Canadian life, to accept and be accepted, to understand and be understood."
37th,3rd,"When we look around us at Canada today, we see many strengths, many achievementsâa society with an enviable quality of life and so much potential, so much talent."
37th,3rd,We can build on these strengths to expand our horizons and enlarge our ambitions.
37th,3rd,"Canadians have already taken up that challenge. They have embraced change with a new confidence. Canadians know who they are and what they want. They want a government that helps shape that course, that leads the wayâand that also engages them in building the future."
37th,3rd,We want governments to reflect our values in the actions they take. This includes living within our means; investing as we can afford; and looking to the future.
37th,3rd,"Canadians want their government to do more than just settle for the status quo. They want a government that can lead change, develop a national consensus on common goals and have the wisdom to help all of us achieve them."
37th,3rd,The goals of the Government of Canada are clear.
37th,3rd,"We want a Canada with strong social foundations, where people are treated with dignity, where they are given a hand when needed, where no one is left behind. Where Canadiansâfamilies and communitiesâhave the tools to find local solutions for local problems."
37th,3rd,"We want a strong economy for the 21st century, with well-paying and meaningful work; ready at the forefront of the next big technological revolution; and built on a solid fiscal foundation."
37th,3rd,"We want for Canada a role of pride and influence in the world, where we speak with an independent voice, bringing distinctive Canadian values to international affairs. It is time to take our place, meet our responsibilities, carry our weight."
37th,3rd,Today the Government is proposing an ambitious agenda to set our country on this path. An agenda that should be measured and judged by the goals we have set and by the resolve and constancy by which they are pursued.
37th,3rd,"Achievements of worth and permanence take time. But that is no excuse for inaction. The Government is committed to making the down payments needed now and to build consistently on these steps as resources permit. So that, a decade hence, we will see that today we made the right choices for the country."
37th,3rd,This Speech from the Throne marks the start of a new government; a new agenda; a new way of working.
37th,3rd,"It marks a renewal, built on partnership, opportunity, achievementâand the real engagement of Canadians."
37th,3rd,Changing the way things work in Ottawa
37th,3rd,"The path to achievement begins with making sure that Canadians believe their government, so that they can believe in government."
37th,3rd,We must re-engage citizens in Canadaâs political life. And this has to begin in the place where it should mean the mostâin Parliamentâby making Parliament work better. That means reconnecting citizens with their Members of Parliament.
37th,3rd,"That means a new partnership with provinces and territories, focused on the interests of Canadians. That also means greater transparency, ethical standards, and financial accountability in how we govern."
37th,3rd,The Government of Canada is determined to return Parliament to the centre of national debate and decision making and to restore the publicâs faith and trust in the integrity and good management of government.
37th,3rd,"To that end, it will, as a first step, immediately table in Parliament an action plan for democratic reform."
37th,3rd,"This will include significantly more free votes, so that Members can represent the views of their constituents as they see fit."
37th,3rd,This will include an enhanced role for Members to shape laws.
37th,3rd,"An enhanced role for Parliamentary Committees, so that Members can hold the Government to greater accountâand can play a key role in reviewing senior appointments."
37th,3rd,"A more active role for Parliamentary Secretaries, for greater engagement between the Government and Parliament and with Canadians."
37th,3rd,"Significantly enhancing the role of all MPs will make Parliament what it was intended to beâa place where Canadians can see and hear their views debated and their interests heard. In short, a place where they can have an influence on the policies that affect their lives."
37th,3rd,Restoring trust and accountability
37th,3rd,Democratic renewal must also restore trust. Too many Canadians are alienated from their governments. This must be reversed.
37th,3rd,"Canadians want the Government of Canada to do better in meeting ethical standards. That is why, as one of its first acts, the Government enhanced the ethics code for all federal public office holders. And that is also why the Government will ask Parliament to immediately reinstate and adopt legislation establishing an independent Ethics Commissioner reporting to Parliament and an Ethics Officer for the Senate."
37th,3rd,"And this is why the Government created a new agency for continuing excellence in public service. A professional, non-partisan public serviceâdrawing on the talents and commitment of Canadians from every regionâis a source of strength and advantage. Our public servants have an important role in this agenda of change. They want to improve how we govern. Canadians deserve the best public service possibleâand our agenda demands it."
37th,3rd,"Democratic renewal means that government programs deliver on objectives, that they deliver what matters in peopleâs lives. Canadians expect government to respect their tax dollars. They want to have the confidence that public moneyâtheir moneyâis wisely spent."
37th,3rd,"To this end, the Government is launching an ongoing process of expenditure review, overseen by a new Committee of Cabinet. This will ensure that spending reflects priorities and that every tax dollar is invested with care to achieve results for Canadians."
37th,3rd,A stronger relationship
37th,3rd,Democratic renewal means opening the doors in Ottawa to the voices of our provinces and territoriesâall our regionsâand adopting new ways of working together on behalf of Canadians.
37th,3rd,"Jurisdiction must be respected. But Canadians do not go about their daily lives worried about which jurisdiction does this or that. They expect, rightly, that their governments will co-operate in common purpose for the common goodâeach working from its strength. They expect them to just get on with the job."
37th,3rd,That is why the Government is determined to put relations with provinces and territories on a more constructive footing.
37th,3rd,Strengthening Canadaâs social foundations
37th,3rd,"Changing the way things work in Government will help all Canadians to achieve their goals, starting with strengthening Canadaâs social foundations."
37th,3rd,That means ensuring that all Canadians have the opportunity to develop and use skills and knowledge to their fullest. It means removing barriers to opportunity. It means building on the fundamental fairness of Canadians. Because our enormous good fortune demands nothing less.
37th,3rd,This philosophy is given concrete expression in our system of universal health care; in social programs that seek to level the playing field for everyone; in programs to provide our seniors with income assistance and care when needed; in our openness to immigrants and refugees and abhorrence of racism; in our commitment to gender equality; in measures to better the opportunities for Aboriginal Canadians.
37th,3rd,Partnership for a healthy Canada
37th,3rd,"The Governmentâs commitment to health care rests on one fundamental tenet: that every Canadian have timely access to quality care, regardless of income or geographyâaccess when they need it."
37th,3rd,"The Government is committed to this goal: universal, high-quality, publicly funded health care, consistent with the principles of medicare, as set out in the Canada Health Act."
37th,3rd,The length of waiting times for the most important diagnoses and treatments is a litmus test of our health care system. These waiting times must be reduced.
37th,3rd,This will require fundamental reform and improvement in the facilities and procedures of the entire health care system.
37th,3rd,But there is much we can do right now.
37th,3rd,"The Prime Minister announced on Friday that the Government of Canada has determined that, without going into deficit, it will now be able to provide a further $2 billion health-care transfer to the provinces and territories this year. Funds to help reduce waiting times; to improve access to diagnostic services; to provide for more doctors and more nurses."
37th,3rd,"Looking forward, the Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners on the necessary reforms and long-term sustainability of the health system. And it will support the Health Council in the development of information on which waiting-time objectives can be set, and by which Canadians can judge progress toward them."
37th,3rd,"Canadians also want to be protected from emerging threats to their health, from global epidemics to contaminated water. Safeguarding the health of Canadians is a top priority of this Government."
37th,3rd,The shock of SARS demonstrated vividly our vulnerability to infectious diseases that may be incubated anywhere on earth.
37th,3rd,Diseases such as SARS and the recent avian flu pose threats which increased global mobility can only make worse.
37th,3rd,"The Government will therefore take the lead in establishing a strong and responsive public health system, starting with a new Canada Public Health Agency that will ensure that Canada is linked, both nationally and globally, in a network for disease control and emergency response."
37th,3rd,The Government will also appoint a new Chief Public Health Officer for Canadaâand undertake a much-needed overhaul of federal health protection through a Canada Health Protection Act.
37th,3rd,"Strengthening our social foundations also means improving the overall health of Canadiansâstarting with health promotion to help reduce the incidence of avoidable disease. The Government will work with all of its partners to that end, following the age-old prescription that prevention is the best cure."
37th,3rd,Caring for our children
37th,3rd,"The future of our children is, quite literally, Canadaâs future."
37th,3rd,"Science teaches that the early years can shapeâor limitâoneâs future, that early and effective intervention can have enduring benefits."
37th,3rd,"Governments are not parents, but they do have a role to play in helping to make sure that families get the supports and tools that they need and in protecting children from exploitation and abuse."
37th,3rd,"We must ensure that every child gets the best possible start in life; that all of Canadaâs children enter school ready to learn; that we protect their health, their happiness, and their freedom to grow in mind and in body without fear. These are the foundations of healthy early childhood development."
37th,3rd,That is the goal. And there are important steps we can take nowâdown payments on an enduring commitment.
37th,3rd,"First, in co-operation with the provinces and territories, the Government will accelerate initiatives under the existing Multilateral Framework for Early Learning and Child Care, which means more quality child care more quickly."
37th,3rd,"Second, to help communities identify children whose readiness to learn is at risk, the Government will extend its successful community pilot project, Understanding the Early Years, to at least 100 communities. Communities themselves can do much for their children with the right knowledge and tools."
37th,3rd,"Third, the Government will do more to ensure the safety of children through a strategy to counter sexual exploitation of children on the Internet and by reinstating child protection legislation."
37th,3rd,Creating opportunity for Canadians with disabilities
37th,3rd,"Many Canadians with disabilities are ready to contribute but confront difficult obstacles in the workplace and in their communities. And too often, families are left on their own to care for a severely disabled relative. Here too, the Government of Canada has a role."
37th,3rd,"We want a Canada in which citizens with disabilities have the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from Canadaâs prosperityâas learners, workers, volunteers, and family members."
37th,3rd,Canada cannot afford to squander the talents of people with disabilities or turn its back on those who seek to provide care and a life of dignity for family members with severe disabilities.
37th,3rd,The Government will start by working with the provinces and territories to fill the gaps in education and skills development and in workplace supports and workplace accommodation for people with disabilities.
37th,3rd,"It will lead by example in supporting the hiring, accommodation and retention of Canadians with disabilities in the Government of Canadaâthe nationâs largest employerâand in federally regulated industries."
37th,3rd,"The Government will also improve the fairness of the tax system for people with disabilities, and their supporting families, based on the findings of the Advisory Committee on Tax Measures, which will report this fall and will implement early actions in areas of priority."
37th,3rd,Aboriginal Canadians
37th,3rd,"Aboriginal Canadians have not fully shared in our nationâs good fortune. While some progress has been made, the conditions in far too many Aboriginal communities can only be described as shameful. This offends our values. It is in our collective interest to turn the corner. And we must start now."
37th,3rd,Our goal is to see Aboriginal children get a better start in life as a foundation for greater progress in acquiring the education and work-force skills needed to succeed.
37th,3rd,Our goal is to see real economic opportunities for Aboriginal individuals and communities.
37th,3rd,"To see Aboriginal Canadians participating fully in national life, on the basis of historic rights and agreementsâwith greater economic self-reliance, a better quality of life."
37th,3rd,The Government of Canada will work with First Nations to improve governance in their communitiesâto enhance transparency and accountabilityâbecause this is the prerequisite to effective self-government and economic development. Aboriginal leadership is committed to this end and rapid progress is essential.
37th,3rd,"In order to support governance capacity in Aboriginal communities and to enhance effective dialogue, the Government will, in co-operation with First Nations, establish an independent Centre for First Nations Government."
37th,3rd,"The Government will also focus on education and skills development, because this is a prerequisite to individual opportunity and full participation. To pursue this goal, the Government will work with provinces and territories and Aboriginal partners in a renewed Aboriginal Human Resources Development Strategy."
37th,3rd,"Too often, the needs of Aboriginal people off reserve are caught up in jurisdictional wrangling. These issues cannot deter us. The Government of Canada will work with its partners on practical solutions to help Aboriginal people respond to the unique challenges they face. To this end, the Government will expand the successful Urban Aboriginal Strategy with willing provinces and municipalities."
37th,3rd,The Government will also engage other levels of government and MÃ©tis leadership on the place of the MÃ©tis in its policies.
37th,3rd,"The Government is committed to a more coherent approach to Aboriginal issues. To focus this effort, it has established a new Cabinet Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, chaired by the Prime Minister; a Parliamentary Secretary; and an Aboriginal Affairs Secretariat in the Privy Council Office."
37th,3rd,Great places to liveâa new deal for communities
37th,3rd,"Our communities, our towns, our cities are key to our social goals and our economic competitiveness. Large and small, rural and urban, Canadaâs communities are facing new challenges, often without sufficient resources or the tools they need."
37th,3rd,"Canada depends on communities that can attract the best talent and compete for investment as vibrant centres of commerce, learning, and culture. We want communities that provide affordable housing, good transit, quality health care, excellent schools, safe neighbourhoods, and abundant green spaces."
37th,3rd,"To this end, the Government of Canada is committed to a new deal for Canadaâs municipalities."
37th,3rd,A new deal that targets the infrastructure needed to support quality of life and sustainable growth.
37th,3rd,"A new deal that helps our communities become more dynamic, more culturally rich, more cohesive, and partners in strengthening Canadaâs social foundations."
37th,3rd,"A new deal that delivers reliable, predictable and long-term funding."
37th,3rd,"Therefore, the Government will work with provinces to share with municipalities a portion of gas tax revenues or to determine other fiscal mechanisms which achieve the same goals."
37th,3rd,"This will take time and the agreement of other governments. But the Government of Canada is prepared now, as a down payment, to act in its own jurisdiction by providing all municipalities with full relief from the portion of the Goods and Services Tax they now pay."
37th,3rd,"Over the next decade, this will provide Canadaâs municipalities with approximately $7 billion of stable new funding to help meet critical priorities."
37th,3rd,"The Government will also move to quickly commit funds within our existing infrastructure programs, so that our partners can plan properly."
37th,3rd,"Together, these are real and ongoing investments in urban transit, affordable housing, clean water, and good roads. Canadaâs municipalities asked for this. The Government has acted."
37th,3rd,"Canadaâs municipalities can play a crucial role in helping the Government meet its national prioritiesâfor the integration of immigrants, for opportunities for Aboriginal Canadians living in urban centres, for tackling homelessness, and for emergency preparedness and response. The new deal means that city hall has a real seat at the table of national change."
37th,3rd,And the Government will help communities to help themselves.
37th,3rd,"One of the best ways to do this is to get behind the remarkable people who are applying entrepreneurial skills, not for profit, but rather to enhance the social and environmental conditions in our communities right across Canada."
37th,3rd,"These new approaches to community developmentâsometimes referred to as the âsocial economyââare producing more and more success stories about a turn around in individual lives and distressed neighbourhoodsâcommunities working to combat homelessness, address poverty and clean up the environment."
37th,3rd,"The Government of Canada wants to support those engaged in this entrepreneurial social movement. It will increase their access to resources and tools. The Government will, for example, work to widen the scope of programs currently available to small and medium-sized enterprises to include social enterprises."
37th,3rd,"The voluntary sector and the millions of Canadian volunteers are essential contributors to the quality, fairness and vitality of our communities. The Government will continue to advance the Voluntary Sector Initiative, to strengthen the capacity and voice of philanthropic and charitable organizations and to mobilize volunteers."
37th,3rd,"Another defining characteristic of our communities and of our reputation around the world is the vitality and excellence of our cultural life. Canadaâs artists and cultural enterprises are among our best ambassadors, as well as being an increasingly dynamic element of the knowledge economy. Their work holds a mirror on our society and builds a legacy for future generations."
37th,3rd,The Government will work with parliamentarians to modernize our arts and culture policies and federal cultural institutions to bring to bear the new technological possibilities of the digital age and to reflect Canadaâs regional diversity and multiculturalism.
37th,3rd,Linguistic duality is at the heart of our identity. It is our image in the world. It opens doors for us.
37th,3rd,"The Government will nurture this asset, which benefits all Canadians. It will ensure that minority language communities have the tools that enable their members to fully contribute to the development of Canadian society."
37th,3rd,Building a 21st century economy
37th,3rd,"A strong economy, built to succeed in the 21st century, is the pre-condition to fulfilling our aspirations, as a nation and as individuals."
37th,3rd,"A nationâs social and economic goals are inseparable. A stronger economy requires stronger social foundations. And if we want to build a fairer, more equitable society, we need a stronger economy."
37th,3rd,Where do we want to be a decade from now?
37th,3rd,"We want a Canada that is a world leader in developing and applying the path-breaking technologies of the 21st centuryâbiotechnology, environmental technology, information and communications technologies, health technologies, and nanotechnology. Applying these capabilities to all sectors to build globally competitive firms, from start-ups to multinationals. And creating high-quality jobs that will meet the ambitions of young Canadiansâand keep them in this country, working to build an even greater Canada."
37th,3rd,We foresee a Canada that is a magnet for capital and entrepreneurs from around the world.
37th,3rd,A Canada where the increasing number of women entrepreneurs have every opportunity to succeed and contribute a vital new dimension to our economy.
37th,3rd,"A Canada built on innovation with world-class research universities, smart regulation and innovative financing, all combining to make Canada a global leader in the commercialization of bright ideas."
37th,3rd,"A Canada where the benefits of the 21st century economy are being reaped from coast to coast to coastâon our farms, in our fishing, forest, and mining industries, and in our rural communities where modern communications are helping to surmount the barrier of distance."
37th,3rd,This will be achieved primarily through the efforts of Canadians themselves. But government has an essential enabling role.
37th,3rd,"A sound macroeconomic environment is fundamental. To ensure that the hard-won gains of the past decade are never squandered, the Government of Canada is unalterably committed to fiscal prudence, as evidenced by annual balanced budgets and steady reduction in the debt relative to the size of the economy. This Government will not spend itself into deficit."
37th,3rd,"Canada is a trading nation. And a 21st century economy is an economy open to the world. Canadian goods, services, capital, people, and knowledge must be able to reach international markets."
37th,3rd,"There are growing opportunities for Canadian exporters and investors to complement our enormously successful relationship with the United States by building closer economic ties with other regions of the world. In particular, more attention will be focused on such newly emerging economic giants as China, India, and Brazil."
37th,3rd,Lifelong learning
37th,3rd,Investing in people will be Canadaâs most important economic investment.
37th,3rd,"The Governmentâs goal is to ensure that a lack of financial resources will not be allowed to deny, to those with the motivation and capacity, the opportunity to learn and aspire to excellence in pursuing a skilled trade, a community college diploma, or university degree."
37th,3rd,"To advance this objective, the Government of Canada will work with provinces and territories to modernize the Canada Student Loans Program to help overcome financial barriers to post-secondary education and training. It will update and improve grants and loans to increase access for middle-and low-income families and their children and to reflect the rising cost of education."
37th,3rd,"Loan limits will be increased, in recognition of the rising cost of education."
37th,3rd,"Eligible expenses will be broadened to include the new essentials, such as computers."
37th,3rd,"Family income thresholds will be raised to improve access for middle income families, squeezed by rising costs."
37th,3rd,Measures will be taken to improve loan terms for part-time students.
37th,3rd,"But the answer to improved access must go beyond simply more generous loans, because a growing debt load poses its own limits, both psychologically and financially."
37th,3rd,"The Government will therefore provide a new grant for low-income students, to cover a portion of the tuition cost of the first year of post-secondary education."
37th,3rd,"More is also needed to encourage greater savings by families for their childrenâs education, starting from the earliest years of life. The Registered Education Savings Plan and associated savings grant have been extraordinarily successful stimulants, but participation by lower income familiesâoften those who could most benefitâhas been disappointingly low. The Government will therefore create new incentives that truly work to encourage low-income families to begin investing, right from the birth of their children, for their long-term education."
37th,3rd,"To meet the challenges of the new economy, Canadaâs workers must have the opportunity to upgrade their skills, to improve their literacy, to learn on the job, to move onto the path of lifelong learning."
37th,3rd,"The Government will therefore refine and enhance its programs to encourage skills upgrading, in concert with sector councils, unions, and business."
37th,3rd,"The Government will also work with provinces to update labour market programming to better reflect the realities of work in the 21st century, such as the growth of self-employment and the need for continuous upgrading of skills."
37th,3rd,We will also deepen the pool of Canadaâs talent and skills by ensuring more successful integration of new immigrants into the economy and into communities. Immigrants have helped to build Canada from its inception and will be key to our future prosperity. The Government will do its part to ensure speedier recognition of foreign credentials and prior work experience. It will also implement measures to inform prospective immigrants and encourage the acquisition of necessary credentials before they arrive in Canada.
37th,3rd,Science and technology
37th,3rd,"Canadian entrepreneurs have made great strides in building the innovative, technology-enabled economy needed to succeed in the years ahead. The Government of Canada has helped lay the foundation for even greater success with very substantial investments in basic researchâ$13 billion since 1997."
37th,3rd,These investments are ensuring a continued flow of basic knowledge and highly trained people on which our future economic success depends.
37th,3rd,Now we must do much more to ensure that our knowledge investment is converted to commercial success. We need to do more to get our ideas and innovations out of our minds and into the marketplace.
37th,3rd,"Our small, innovative firms face two key obstaclesâaccess to adequate early-stage financing; and the capacity to conduct the research and development needed to commercialize their ideas and really grow their business."
37th,3rd,"The Government will help to overcome these obstaclesâbuilding, for example, on the venture financing capabilities of the Business Development Bank."
37th,3rd,"The Government will create access to capital for the commercialization of science in areas where we can be among the world leadersâin environment, in health, in biotechnology, and in nanotechnology."
37th,3rd,The Government will also build on the experience and nationwide reach of the National Research Council to help small firms bridge the commercialization gap by providing the research and expertise that small business cannot develop on its own.
37th,3rd,"To help integrate and focus these efforts, Canadaâs new National Science Advisor will re-engage universities, colleges, and enterprise in a truly national science agenda."
37th,3rd,Regional and rural development
37th,3rd,"The 21st century economy promises opportunity for all parts of Canada. The objective of the Government is to ensure that every region of the country has the opportunity to move forward, socially and economically, on a rising tide of progress. As we share opportunity, so too will we share prosperity."
37th,3rd,"The Government therefore remains committed to supporting economic development through the regional agencies where the focus must be on strengthening the sinews of an economy for the 21st century, building on indigenous strength."
37th,3rd,The Government will place increased emphasis on opportunities to add greater value to natural resources through application of advanced technology and know-how; on opportunities to develop Canadaâs energy resources and be a leader in environmental stewardship; and on opportunities to maximize the potential of our vast coastal and offshore areas through a new Oceans Action Plan.
37th,3rd,"It will develop a Northern strategy, ensuring that economic development related to energy and mining is brought on stream in partnership with Northern Canadians, based on stewardship of our most fragile northern ecosystems."
37th,3rd,The Government is dedicated to Canadaâs farm economy and to taking the steps necessary to safeguard access to international markets and to ensure that farmers are not left to bear alone the consequences of circumstances beyond their control. It is also committed to fostering a technologically advanced agricultural sector with the supporting infrastructure of transportation and applied science to make the competitiveness of Canadian farmers and the safety of our food second to none in world markets.
37th,3rd,Sustainable development
37th,3rd,"Safeguarding our natural environmentâin the here and now, and for generations to comeâis one of the great responsibilities of citizens and governments in the 21st century."
37th,3rd,The tide of global population and the imperatives of economic developmentâno longer restricted to the small minority of rich countriesâmake sustainable development a challenge of national and global magnitude.
37th,3rd,"Canadians, as stewards of vast geography and abundant resources, feel a keen sense of responsibility to help the world meet the environmental challenge."
37th,3rd,"And in so doing, to show how this challenge can be turned to advantage through leadership in âgreen technologiesâ; through more energy-efficient transportation and housing; and through non-polluting industrial processes. All of which will stimulate innovation, new market opportunities, and cleaner communities."
37th,3rd,This spirit will animate Canadaâs approach to climate change.
37th,3rd,Halting the increasingly damaging impact of human activity on climate is a project of global scale and decades duration.
37th,3rd,"The Government of Canada will respect its commitments to the Kyoto accord on climate change in a way that produces long-term and enduring results while maintaining a strong and growing economy. It will do so by developing an equitable national plan, in partnership with provincial and territorial governments and other stakeholders."
37th,3rd,"We have begun, and we will persevere. And we will go beyond Kyoto to strengthen our environmental stewardship."
37th,3rd,"First, the Government will begin by putting its own house in order. It will undertake a 10-year, $3.5 billion program to clean up contaminated sites for which the Government is responsible. And the Government of Canada will augment this with a $500 million program of similar duration to do its part in the remediation of certain other sites, notably the Sydney tar ponds."
37th,3rd,"Second, the Government will intensify its commitment to clean air and clean water. We will engage the United States on trans-boundary issues and the provinces to achieve more stringent national guidelines on air and water quality. And we are committing the resources needed to ensure safe drinking water in First Nationsâ communities."
37th,3rd,"Third, building on recommendations of the National Roundtable on the Environment and the Economy, the Government will start incorporating key indicators on clean water, clean air, and emissions reduction into its decision making."
37th,3rd,"Fourth, the Government will increase the resources to support innovative environmental technologies and further encourage their commercialization."
37th,3rd,"Fifth, we will engage Canadians directly. Our One Tonne Challenge aims to raise awareness and provide Canadians with information on how their individual consumption choices contribute to the emissions that drive climate change. The objectiveâthe challengeâis to reduce emissions by 1,000 kilograms per person, per year. Because environmental stewardship must be everybodyâs responsibility."
37th,3rd,Canadaâs role in the world
37th,3rd,"Canadians are uniquely positioned for the new global realitiesâopen to the world, comfortable with the interdependence of nations, aware of our global responsibilities."
37th,3rd,"Canadians want their country to play a distinctive and independent role in making the world more secure, more peaceful, more co-operative, more open. They want to see Canadaâs place of pride and influence in the world restored."
37th,3rd,What kind of world do we want to see a decade from now?
37th,3rd,We want to see the benefits of global interdependence spread more fairly throughout the world.
37th,3rd,We want agreement on new rules governing international actions when a government fails to protect its own people from tyranny and oppression.
37th,3rd,We want to see multilateral institutions that work. No one nation can manage the consequences of global interdependence on its own.
37th,3rd,"We want to see greater collaboration among nations to ensure that economic policies go hand in hand with stronger social programs to alleviate hunger, poverty, and disease, and to help to raise the standards of living in developing countries."
37th,3rd,Canada can contribute to achieving these goals.
37th,3rd,"We can play a distinctive role based on our valuesâthe rule of law, liberty, democracy, equality of opportunity, and fairness. As others have said: the world needs more Canada."
37th,3rd,"Canada can make a difference and we can more than carry our weight. We need to work better, to work smarter, in diplomacy, in development, in defence and in international tradeâall of which have become profoundly interdependent and are increasingly touching Canadians in their daily lives."
37th,3rd,"To guide us forward in this, the Government has launched an integrated review of its international policiesâthe first such review in a decade of change."
37th,3rd,"The review will be completed this autumn and then considered by a parliamentary committee, where Canadians will have the opportunity to make their views known."
37th,3rd,"Some things, however, need not wait for the reviewâbecause they are urgently needed, or because the right course of action is already clear."
37th,3rd,"There is a moral imperative to do all we can to make medical treatment accessible to the untold millions suffering from deadly infectious diseases, notably HIV/AIDS, particularly in the poorest countries of Africa. The Government of Canada will therefore proceed with legislation to enable the provision of generic drugs to developing countries."
37th,3rd,Canadaâs obligation does not stop there. We are a knowledge-rich country. We must apply more of our research and science to help address the most pressing problems of developing countries.
37th,3rd,"The Government will continue its leadership in the creation of a new international instrument on cultural diversity, participate actively in la Francophonie, and promote and disseminate our cultural products and works around the world."
37th,3rd,"And in 2010, the eyes of the world will be on Canada as Vancouver and Whistler host the Winter Olympics, an opportunity to inspire Canadian pride and achievementâand an opportunity to reinforce participation in sport by Canadians, at the highest level and in our communities."
37th,3rd,Our foreign policy objectives require a meaningful capacity to contribute militarily in support of collective efforts to safeguard international peace and security. Our men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for us when they participate in operations abroadâas we were reminded tragically only last week. All Canadians support them and their families. We must ensure that they have the equipment and training to do the job.
37th,3rd,"To this end, the Government will make immediate investments in key capital equipment, such as new armoured vehicles and replacements for the Sea King helicopters."
37th,3rd,There is no role more fundamental for government than the protection of its citizens.
37th,3rd,"That is why the Government has already established the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness and appointed a National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister. It has also established the Cabinet Committee on Security, Public Health and Emergencies and the new Canada Border Services Agency."
37th,3rd,"Given the responsibility to address new threats, such as non-state terrorism, and to ensure effective emergency management, the Government will develop, with its domestic partners, Canadaâs first national security policy. This will publicly set forth the principles that will guide the Governmentâs actions and serve as a blueprint for effectively securing Canada in a way that strengthens the open nature of our society."
37th,3rd,"Canada and the United States are connected not only by the shared geography of North America and by hugely beneficial trade and investment flowsâthe largest bilateral economic relationship in the worldâbut also by ties of friendship and family, by commonly held democratic values, and by shared interests and responsibilities."
37th,3rd,"The Government is therefore committed to a new, more sophisticated approach to this unique relationship."
37th,3rd,"To ensure a border that is open and effective in handling the volumes of people, goods, and services flowing to and from our economies, the security concerns of both sides must be respected."
37th,3rd,"Building on the success of the Smart Borders initiative, the Government will engage with the United States to further strengthen North American security while facilitating the flow of commerce and travellers. It will also work toward infrastructure investments at key trade corridors to ensure that we can facilitate the expanding trade between our countries."
37th,3rd,Conclusion
37th,3rd,Canada and Canadians are confidently positioned to achieve great things in the years ahead.
37th,3rd,We have set out measured steps consistent with our means. An ambitious agenda for an ambitious country.
37th,3rd,Members of the House of Commons: 
37th,3rd,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
37th,3rd,Honourable Members of the Senate and
37th,3rd,Members of the House of Commons:
37th,3rd,"As you carry out your duties and exercise your responsibilities, may you be guided by Divine Providence."
37th,3rd,Stay Connected
36th,2nd,"Honourable Members of the Senate,  Members of the House of Commons,  Ladies and Gentlemen: "
36th,2nd,"It is an honour for me, today, to open this Second Session of the Thirty-Sixth Parliament of Canada. I appreciate having the opportunity so early in my mandate to represent the Queen as one of the three elements of Parliament. It is a responsibility which I take seriously, and I intend to follow your deliberations closely."
36th,2nd,"Unlike my immediate predecessors, I have not had the privilege of serving among you. I do, however, value highly the role that you play and the dedication that you show in making this remarkable institution work effectively as the centrepiece of the Canadian democratic system. I am very aware of the sacrifices that so many of you make in your personal and professional lives in accepting the challenges of public office. The commitment you have made is one that I share, and I look forward to working with you over the next five years in the service of the people of Canada."
36th,2nd,"Today, the representatives of the Canadian people gather to open the session of Parliament that will carry the country into the new millennium. "
36th,2nd,"We stand before a new century confident in the promise of Canada for our children and grandchildren. Technology is altering every aspect of our lives. Knowledge and creativity are now the driving force in a new economy. And collaboration is becoming more essential as the issues facing our diverse society grow in their complexity. But Canadians will succeed in this changing world, just as we have succeeded throughout our countryâs history."
36th,2nd,"The promise of Canada was born in an age when countries were forged through war or revolution. Our nationâs founders chose a unique path, which has become the Canadian way â creating a country dedicated to peace, order and good government for all its citizens. It took foresight and commitment to break the mould of the nation-state founded on a single language, culture or religion. That foresight and commitment have been greatly rewarded."
36th,2nd,"Canada began as a small colony with little industry and no role of its own in global affairs. Over generations, individual Canadians built a better future for their families and their communities. Canadians and their governments overcame barriers of distance and a harsh northern climate to build a national railway, a system of highways, a postal service, and national cultural institutions, as well as hospitals, universities, and other institutions. Canadians and their governments also put in place a modern social safety net. Together, these achievements have provided the foundation for our quality of life."
36th,2nd,"Within a few generations, we evolved into an independent nation with an advanced industrialized economy and a voice in the councils of the world: the United Nations, the G-8, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, NATO, and many others. Canada is now serving its sixth elected term on the United Nations Security Council."
36th,2nd,"Ours is a voice for peace. Canada was the first to propose the use of troops for peacekeeping. Today, Canadians are keeping the peace in many countries around the world. But whenever tyranny has threatened peace and security, Canadians have never hesitated to answer the call. Together with our proud Canadian veterans, we remember those who paid with their lives at Vimy Ridge, on Juno Beach, and at Hill 355 in Korea."
36th,2nd,"In the tradition of the coureurs des bois, we have explored the frontiers of science. From the invention of newsprint to the creation of advanced computer languages, Canadian ingenuity has helped to build the information age. From the discovery of insulin to the earliest pacemaker, Canadians have given new life to millions around the world. Canada was a pioneer in the peaceful use of space, becoming a leader in satellite communications and remote-sensing technologies. Today, our astronauts are using Canadian technology to help assemble the International Space Station â the largest scientific project in history."
36th,2nd,"In a complex world, diverse approaches, skills and ideas are essential to building a higher quality of life. Canada is a bilingual country in which both men and women of many different cultures, races and religions participate in economic, social and political life. Our diversity is a source of strength and creativity, making us modern and forward-looking."
36th,2nd,"Our actions and our history make us at home in a world of change and increasing interdependence. Our human talent, our values and our commitment to working together will secure Canadaâs leadership in the knowledge-based economy."
36th,2nd,"Today, Canadians can look with pride on Canadaâs success. We have a dynamic economy, a strong and democratic society, and a sense of community. We are recognized throughout the world for our quality of life. We will build a higher quality of life for all Canadians â for our children, ourselves, and our neighbours."
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,A Strong and United Canada
36th,2nd,"A high quality of life for Canadians and a strong, united Canada are inseparable. The Government will continue to take a comprehensive approach to strengthening the unity of our country. All its actions will serve to strengthen Canada by enhancing the quality of life of Canadians."
36th,2nd,"Our federal system allows us to value the different strengths of each region of our country. It guarantees all citizens equal rights and freedoms. And it enables Canadaâs wealth to be shared by all citizens no matter where they live â from Newfoundland in the east, to British Columbia in the west, to our newest territory, Nunavut, in the north."
36th,2nd,"Over the last two Parliaments, Canadians have built a foundation for even greater success. Our economy is strong. Our citizens enjoy expanding opportunities and increasing choices. Our artists, writers, musicians and filmmakers draw admiration from around the world. And Canada itself earns the respect of the community of nations as a symbol of peace, democracy and compassion."
36th,2nd,"The best way to achieve the promise of Canada for every citizen is to work together to build the highest quality of life for all Canadians. But there are some who would pull us apart rather than bring us together. Even though Quebeckers do not want a third referendum, the Government of Quebec continues to talk about holding another one. The Government of Canada therefore reaffirms the commitment it has made to Quebeckers and all other Canadians that the principle of clarity, as set out by the Supreme Court of Canada, will be respected."
36th,2nd,"To seize the opportunities and meet the challenges of a new global economy, we must work together in the Canadian way and concentrate on what matters most to Canadians. We must take bold steps today to make Canada even stronger in the next century. This requires national will, national strategies and partnerships across the country. Citizens and governments must collaboratively build an even stronger and more united Canada, a Canada that remains an example to the world."
36th,2nd,"Canadians expect their national government to focus on areas where it can and must make a difference. And they want this done in the Canadian way â working together, balancing individual and government action, and listening to citizens. Canadians expect their Government to be fiscally prudent, to reduce the debt burden, to cut taxes, and to pursue the policies necessary for a strong society. The emerging global marketplace offers an enormous opportunity to create more Canadian jobs, more Canadian growth and more Canadian influence in the world. It provides expanding opportunities to secure a higher quality of life for all Canadians. To seize these opportunities, we must build on our strengths. "
36th,2nd,"Achieving a higher quality of life requires a comprehensive strategy to accelerate the transition to the knowledge-based economy, promote our interests and project our values in the world. Together, we will strive for excellence. This demands that we collaborate with our partners to:"
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,Children and Youth: Our Leaders for the 21st Century
36th,2nd,Our Children
36th,2nd,"Because of the changing nature of the world economy, the prospects for a high quality of life in any country will depend â as never before â on having a population that is adaptable, resilient and ready to learn throughout life. The foundation for this is laid in the very early years. No commitment we make today will be more important for the long-term prosperity and well-being of our society than the commitment to invest our efforts in very young children. Parents and families have the primary responsibility for the care of their children. But all of society must work together to ensure that our children develop the abilities to succeed."
36th,2nd,"The Government will extend and make more accessible Employment Insurance benefits for parental leave, to help parents take more time from work to spend with their children. It will make its own workplace policies and those of federally regulated employers more family friendly. Through further tax relief, it will put more dollars in the hands of families with children. And, with its provincial and territorial partners, it will work to reform family law and strengthen supports provided to families to ensure that, in cases of separation or divorce, the needs and best interests of children come first."
36th,2nd,"Federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing together the National Childrenâs Agenda. As part of this work, it is the Governmentâs objective to reach an agreement among governments by December 2000 on a national action plan to further support parents and families. This plan will be consistent with the Social Union Framework Agreement. It will set out common principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all governments to increase resources and further strengthen supports for early childhood development."
36th,2nd,"To make it easier for families to break the cycle of poverty, the federal, provincial and territorial governments also established the National Child Benefit. The Government of Canada is already investing an additional $1.7 billion annually in low-income families with children, while the provinces and territories are investing in complementary services. The Government wants no family to have to choose between a job and benefits for their children. Therefore, by 2002, the Government will make a third significant investment in the National Child Benefit, while seeking a commitment from its provincial and territorial partners to increase their investment in services for families with children."
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,Young Canadians
36th,2nd,"Young Canadians are the leaders of tomorrow. Already, they are at home in the wired world. They have energy, ideas and technological savvy, and they want to contribute to building their country in the 21st century. In our global and connected world, young Canadians are acquiring knowledge and skills at an earlier age. They deserve more and earlier opportunities to get involved, develop their talents and expand their skills. In doing so, they will become active and engaged citizens."
36th,2nd,"The Government will focus on providing young people with more opportunities to connect to the Canadian experience, to view their country in all its splendour, to gain a first-hand understanding of the different regions, and to be challenged by what they learn from their fellow citizens across this land. The Government will:"
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,"In addition, the Government will continue to place a priority on providing young Canadians with career information, access to work experience, and learning opportunities."
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,A Dynamic Economy for the 21st Century
36th,2nd,"In the global, knowledge-based economy, the advantage goes to countries that are innovative, have high levels of productivity, quickly adopt the latest technology, invest in skills development for their citizens, and seek out new opportunities around the world."
36th,2nd,"Canadians have built a strong and dynamic economy. It is the cornerstone of our quality of life â providing Canada with the means to continue building a more equitable society, a healthier population, and stronger communities. In the space of only a few years, our nationâs finances have gone from deficits and debt to balanced budgets, with low inflation and low interest rates. Laws and regulations have been modernized and the role of government in business decisions has been reduced."
36th,2nd,"The Government will continue to build a better environment for economic growth and enhanced productivity by reducing the debt burden, cutting taxes, and making strategic investments. Such investments will help small businesses grow, encourage trade, support citizens in developing the skills they need, and ensure that Canada has modern infrastructure."
36th,2nd,"The Government is committed to prudent fiscal management. It will never let the nationâs finances get out of control again. It will keep the ratio of debt to GDP on a permanent downward track. It will deliver on the commitment it made at the beginning of this Parliament to devote half the budget surplus to debt repayment and tax relief, and the other half to investments that address the social and economic needs of Canadians."
36th,2nd,Lower Taxes
36th,2nd,"As the nationâs finances have improved, the Government has begun to deliver broad-based tax relief â totalling $16.5 billion over three years. As the nationâs finances continue to improve, the Government will further reduce taxes to increase the disposable income of Canadians, enhance innovation and risk taking, and create a more robust economy."
36th,2nd,Tax reduction is a key component of a strategy to increase individual incomes and to ensure an economy that produces the growth and wealth which enable those public and private investments necessary for a high quality of life.
36th,2nd,"In its next budget, the Government will set out a multi-year plan for further tax reduction."
36th,2nd,Increased Trade and Investment
36th,2nd,"Canadaâs economy is more open than any of the leading industrialized countries. We are blessed with a population that comes from countries all over the world. Foreign markets for our goods and services provide us with new opportunities. Foreign investment provides us with capital, new ideas, new technologies, and innovative business practices."
36th,2nd,"To build on Canadaâs advantage, the Government will increase its trade promotion in strategic sectors with high export potential â sectors ranging from biotechnology and environmental and information technology to tourism, culture and health. It will also continue to support innovation and the development of new technologies in leading export sectors such as agriculture, agri-food and natural resources. "
36th,2nd,It will launch Investment Team Canada â a co-ordinated effort by all governments and the private sector to make the international community more aware of the unique opportunities for investment and growth in Canada. The Government will also modernize legislation to make it easier for global corporations to locate their headquarters in Canada.
36th,2nd,"The Government will use the upcoming round of World Trade Organization negotiations, including those on agriculture, to help build a more transparent, rules-based global trading system â one that ensures a level playing field, provides better access to world markets for Canadian companies in all sectors, and respects the needs of Canadians, our culture, and the environment. In addition, the Government will work with its partners in the hemisphere toward the establishment of the Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005."
36th,2nd,Skills and Knowledge for the 21st Century
36th,2nd,A skilled workforce and a capacity to innovate continuously are crucial building blocks of a successful 21st century economy.
36th,2nd,"Over the last three years, the Government has put in place a strategy to build on Canadaâs advantage as the country with the most highly educated workforce in the world. It has made it easier to save for a childâs education. It will make college and university more affordable through Canada Millennium Scholarships. It has improved student debt relief and provided better tax assistance to finance lifelong learning."
36th,2nd,"We will continue to build on this strategy. The Government will forge partnerships with other governments, public- and private-sector organizations, and Canadian men and women to establish a national action plan on skills and learning for the 21st century. This plan will focus on lifelong learning, address the challenge of poor literacy among adults, and provide citizens with the information they need to make good decisions about developing their skills."
36th,2nd,"Over the next two years, the Government will work with its partners to:"
36th,2nd,"To ensure that the Public Service of Canada remains a strong, representative, professional and non-partisan national institution that provides Canadians the highest quality service into the 21st century, the Government will also focus on the recruitment, retention and continuous learning of a skilled federal workforce."
36th,2nd,Infrastructure for the 21st Century
36th,2nd,"For Canada to generate jobs, growth and wealth, it must have a leading, knowledge-based economy that creates new ideas and puts them to work for Canadians. To do this, it is essential to connect Canadians to each other, to schools and libraries, to governments, and to the marketplace â so they can build on each otherâs ideas and share information. Achieving this objective will require new types of infrastructure."
36th,2nd,Knowledge Infrastructure
36th,2nd,"Improving Canadaâs knowledge infrastructure means supporting a new generation of leaders, attracting the best researchers, and encouraging our graduates to put their talents to work here at home."
36th,2nd,"The Government will introduce the legislation necessary to create the Canadian Institutes of Health Research. These institutes will provide a model for world-leading research, bringing together for the first time all the researchers who have an impact on health to undertake shared research priorities. This innovative approach recognizes the importance of collaborative research for improving the health and well-being of Canadians and for building a high-quality health system."
36th,2nd,"The Government of Canada has for many years been one of the most important contributors to research at Canadian universities. In the last two years, the Government has pursued an ambitious agenda to improve its support for advanced research in Canada. To build on this agenda, the Government will:"
36th,2nd,"The Government will also ensure that it has a modern and effective research and science capacity to promote the health, safety and economic well-being of Canadians."
36th,2nd,Information Infrastructure
36th,2nd,"Improving Canadaâs information infrastructure will support the exchange of ideas and the conduct of business over computer networks, connect Canadians to the information highway, and accelerate the adoption of electronic commerce. The Government will:"
36th,2nd,"The Government will become a model user of information technology and the Internet. By 2004, our goal is to be known around the world as the government most connected to its citizens, with Canadians able to access all government information and services on-line at the time and place of their choosing. We will build on a pilot project now under way to make www.access.ca a personal gateway to government information and community content on the Internet, and we will encourage all Canadians to make use of this address."
36th,2nd,"Our knowledge-based economy is more than high-tech companies. It is an economy in which all sectors strive to use leading technologies and processes. It is an economy in which old barriers to access or of distance matter less â where technology enables urban and rural communities from the Atlantic to the West to the North to compete globally, and where technology opens new doors to all Canadians. It is an economy in which rural Canada also benefits from value-added activity, environmentally astute land management, and new job skills and opportunities. It is an economy in which clusters of technology development already exist in smaller communities all over Canada. Indeed, it is an economy in which technology can lead to greater economic stability for the primarily rural regions in which cyclical resource industries â agriculture, fisheries, forestry, mining and tourism â are the dominant sources of wealth. The Government will encourage the development and adoption of new technologies in all sectors."
36th,2nd,Cultural Infrastructure
36th,2nd,"The strength of Canada is reflected in its rich diversity. Across this country, Canadaâs culture comes alive through our writers, singers and performers, through our filmmakers and artists, and through those who chronicle our history and preserve our heritage."
36th,2nd,"New technologies offer new opportunities to strengthen the bonds between Canadians. The Government will bring Canadian culture into the digital age, linking 1,000 institutions across the country to form a virtual museum of Canada. It will put collections from the National Archives, National Library and other key institutions on-line. It will also increase support for the production of Canadian stories and images in print, theatre, film, music and video. In particular, it will increase support for the use of new media."
36th,2nd,Physical Infrastructure
36th,2nd,"Canada must also continue to improve its physical infrastructure for the 21st century. To increase trade and economic growth, we must ensure that we have the capacity to move people and goods safely and efficiently. To maintain the quality of life in our cities and rural communities, we must ensure that we have clean air and water. "
36th,2nd,"The Government will work with other levels of government and the private sector to reach â by the end of the year 2000 â agreement on a five-year plan for improving physical infrastructure in urban and rural regions across the country. This agreement will set out shared principles, objectives and fiscal parameters for all partners to increase their resources directed toward infrastructure. It will focus on areas such as transport, tourism, telecommunications, culture, health and safety, and the environment."

36th,2nd,Health and Quality Care for Canadians
36th,2nd,"Good health and quality care are essential to the well-being of all Canadians and are part of our strength in todayâs global marketplace. Advances in technology, research and information are opening tremendous new opportunities for improving the health and well-being of citizens."
36th,2nd,Canadians expect their governments to work together to ensure that Canadaâs health care system is modern and sustainable. The Government recently reaffirmed its commitment to medicare by investing an additional $11.5 billion to modernize the health system for the beginning of the 21st century. The Government will continue to move forward with its provincial and territorial partners and the health care community on common priorities.
36th,2nd,"With its partners, the Government will support the testing of innovations in integrated service delivery in areas such as home care and pharmacare, working toward a health system in which all parts operate seamlessly. As the results of these innovations become available, we will be better able to make informed decisions about the next significant investments in health â ensuring that our health system meets the evolving needs of all Canadians."
36th,2nd,A modern health information system will give health professionals and individual citizens improved access to up-to-date information about health issues and treatment options. The Government will ensure that citizens in every region of the country have access to such information so they can make better-informed decisions.
36th,2nd,"The Government will protect the health of Canadians by strengthening Canadaâs food safety program, by taking further action on environmental health issues, including the potential health risks presented by pesticides, and by modernizing overall health protection for a changing world."
36th,2nd,"We will also continue to address the serious health problems in Aboriginal communities, supporting their efforts to promote wellness and to strengthen the delivery of health services."
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,The Quality of Our Environment
36th,2nd,The long-term economic and social well-being of every Canadian depends on the state of our natural environment. Canadaâs ability to adopt innovative environmental practices and technologies will increasingly be part of Canadaâs strength in the 21st century.
36th,2nd,"Canadians have long recognized the underlying relationship between a healthy environment and a high quality of life. Canadians and leading businesses are already working in their own communities to preserve the natural environment, pushing the frontiers and opportunities of environmental technologies and new eco-efficient practices."
36th,2nd,The quality of the environment in our communities is also linked to the environmental health of other communities around the world. Problems such as climate change and dangerous levels of persistent toxins can be resolved only through concerted international action.
36th,2nd,"Within Canada, the Government will work with other governments and citizens to meet our countryâs commitment under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It will set and enforce tough pollution standards, in particular to better protect the health of children, seniors and residents of the North. It will place greater emphasis on sustainable development in government decision making. It will also address the structural weaknesses that have been identified in the management of toxic substances. Internationally, Canada will provide technical assistance to developing countries in adopting sustainable practices."
36th,2nd,"The Government will introduce legislation and stewardship programs, working with provinces and territories to ensure that species at risk and their critical natural habitat are protected. The Government will also continue to extend Canadaâs national parks system."
36th,2nd,"In its own operations, the Government will make itself a model of environmental excellence. It will do more to clean up contaminated federal sites. It will strengthen its capacity for conducting environmental science research. It will also explore new environmental clean-up technologies. "
36th,2nd,The Government will report regularly on the results achieved in addressing the top environmental concerns of Canadians.

36th,2nd,Building Stronger Communities
36th,2nd,Working Together
36th,2nd,"Our history has been one of Canadians helping Canadians to seize opportunities and rise to challenges. This commitment to working together â by Canadians, their governments and their communities â will ensure Canadaâs continued success in addressing the complex issues of the 21st century."
36th,2nd,"The Social Union Framework Agreement, reached earlier this year, is a commitment by governments to work together for Canadians. It calls for governments to report publicly on the effectiveness of social programs. It also commits governments to eliminating barriers that unjustifiably impede the mobility of citizens within Canada. These barriers include rules that prevent some citizens from obtaining recognition of their qualifications when they move to another province, that deny some students use of their student loans when they study out-of-province, and that restrict access to essential services for some citizens â including those with disabilities â because of their province of origin. The Government of Canada is committed to working together with its partners to meet the deadlines set out in the Social Union Framework Agreement, thereby removing all unjustifiable barriers to mobility no later than 2002."
36th,2nd,"In 2001, Canadians will mark the International Year of Volunteers â a time to celebrate the achievements of Canadaâs everyday heroes. The Government recognizes the need to build partnerships with communities and to renew its relationship with the voluntary organizations that serve and sustain them. The Government will enter into a national accord with the voluntary sector, laying a new foundation for active partnership with voluntary organizations in the service of Canadians."
36th,2nd,"Strong communities depend on the participation of all their members. To this end, the Government will pursue its efforts with other governments, the private and voluntary sectors, and all citizens to build communities in which Canadians with disabilities are fully included and in which new Canadians feel more at home."
36th,2nd,"In addition, the Government will continue working with its partners in all sectors to address the root causes of homelessness and help communities respond to their membersâ needs for shelter and other support."
36th,2nd,Promoting Safer Communities
36th,2nd,Canadians are justifiably proud of having built communities where citizens feel safe. This is a key component of our quality of life and a contributor to Canadaâs comparative advantage.
36th,2nd,"The Government will work with Canadians to ensure that our communities continue to be safe. Its focus will be balanced, combining prevention and a community-centred approach with action to deal with serious crime. It will expand the community-based crime prevention strategy and re-introduce legislation to reform the youth justice system. The Government will combat drug trafficking while helping communities aid those most affected. It will also launch a program of restorative justice to help victims overcome the trauma of crime and provide non-violent offenders with a chance to help repair the damage caused by their actions."
36th,2nd,"The Government will focus attention on new and emerging threats to Canadians and their neighbours around the world. It will work to combat criminal activity that is becoming increasingly global in scope, including money laundering, terrorism, and the smuggling of people, drugs and guns. "
36th,2nd,"The Government will strengthen the capacity of the RCMP and other agencies to address threats to public security in Canada and work with enforcement agencies in other countries. In addition, it will work to modernize legislation to better ensure public security. "
36th,2nd,The Government of Canada will also continue to work closely with the Government of the United States to modernize our shared border for the 21st century.
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,A Stronger Relationship with Canadaâs Aboriginal Peoples
36th,2nd,The contribution of Canadaâs Aboriginal peoples has shaped our countryâs heritage and will continue to enrich Canada in the new century. The Government will continue to build on the strong foundation of reconciliation and renewal created by Gathering Strength â Canadaâs Aboriginal Action Plan.
36th,2nd,"We are now building stronger partnerships with Aboriginal people â concentrating on improving their living conditions and, increasingly, on strengthening their economies. As a result, Aboriginal people will be able to more fully participate in and contribute to Canadaâs economic development and social well-being."
36th,2nd,"Fostering good government and strong accountability in First Nations communities will increase investor confidence, support economic partnerships, and improve living conditions. Land claim agreements, in particular, are essential to create certainty for Aboriginal people and their surrounding communities â providing the climate needed for partnerships, investments and economic opportunities. Early in the new session of Parliament, the Government will introduce legislation to implement the historic agreement with the Nisgaâa."
36th,2nd,Â 
36th,2nd,Canadaâs Place in the World
36th,2nd,"As we move into the 21st century, Canada has the momentum to lead the way toward a safer and more secure world. Canadians have built the highest quality of life in the world by focussing on the needs of people. We have the expertise to advance an agenda of human security â protecting people from threats to their rights, their safety and their lives."
36th,2nd,"Canada is an outward-looking country, with a trade-oriented economy and a population drawn from every corner of the globe. We have a reputation internationally for making a difference â through our contribution to eliminating landmines, our work with NATO and the United Nations in Kosovo, our development assistance to Asia and Africa, our efforts to establish the International Criminal Court, and our work to renew the international financial system."
36th,2nd,"As the Cold War recedes into the past, there is a greater need to complement national security with an approach that addresses the growing challenges that undermine the security of individuals. Human security is challenged when children are used as soldiers in combat, when citizens are denied their rights, when civilians are caught in conflict, and when people are the victims of economic crisis, natural disaster, widespread disease, or environmental degradation."
36th,2nd,"Canadians recognize that their quality of life depends in part on the quality of life of their neighbours â those who share this planet with us. A world where people are secure is a world where fewer people are forced to flee their homes, where there is less crime and terrorism, and where there is a reduced threat of disease and pollution."
36th,2nd,"The Government will give increased prominence to human security in its foreign policy, working to achieve meaningful progress in the councils of the world on a global human security agenda."
36th,2nd,"In 2001, the United Nations General Assembly will hold a special session on children. In the spirit of partnership that led to the historic treaty banning landmines, the Government will work to reach key international agreements to protect the rights of children. Canada will champion efforts to eliminate the exploitation of children, including the use of child soldiers in armed conflict, and will help address the crisis of children affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic."
36th,2nd,"The Government will act with like-minded countries to reform and strengthen international institutions such as the United Nations, International Monetary Fund, World Bank and World Trade Organization. It will also work to develop a new approach internationally to support the diversity of cultural expression in countries around the world."
36th,2nd,"To advance Canadaâs leadership in the Arctic region, the Government will outline a foreign policy for the North that enhances co-operation, helps protect the environment, promotes trade and investment, and supports the security of the regionâs people."
36th,2nd,The Government will increase international development assistance and work in innovative ways to enable poor countries to improve the quality of life of their citizens.
36th,2nd,The Government will also continue to ensure that the Canadian Forces have the capacity to support Canadaâs role in building a more secure world and will further develop the capacity of Canadians to help ensure peace and security in foreign lands.

36th,2nd,Honouring Canadaâs Promise for the 21st Century
36th,2nd,"As we prepare to celebrate the turn of the millennium, we can look to our past with pride and to our future with confidence. Like previous generations, we will face new challenges. But guided by our values and our collective experience, we can ensure that Canada remains the best place in the world in which to live â the best place to raise children, to learn, to pursue opportunity, to share in rich, diverse and safe communities, and to admire the beauty of nature."
36th,2nd,"All Canadians â every citizen, every government, every business and every community organization â have a part to play. We will build the 21st century together."
36th,2nd,Â

36th,2nd,"Let the Canadians of tomorrow look upon this Parliament and say, Here were men and women committed to building a stronger Canada and a better quality of life for their children and grandchildren."
36th,2nd,May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
36th,2nd,Stay Connected
36th,1st,"My wife, Diana, and I were happy to welcome Her Majesty the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh when they arrived in Canada last June and to be their hosts during their stay in the National Capital over Canada Day."
36th,1st,"As Governor General I have visited every province and territory, and I wish every Canadian could share that experience. Our cities, towns, and villages reflect the diversity of all those who have come to this country. And yet our communities, whether on the coasts or the prairies, whether in the woodlands or on the northern tundra, show the same friendliness, openness, and generosity."
36th,1st,"People care for each other in many ways, and they give their time and their support to their community."
36th,1st,"When I became Governor General, I stated my intention to honour the generosity of Canadians, especially as demonstrated by volunteers. We have now created the Caring Canadian Award to recognize the most dedicated among them."
36th,1st,"In my functions, I visit with many units of the Canadian Forces. They have impressed me with their dedication, as demonstrated by their peacekeeping role, their heroic work in search and rescue, and their immediate response to natural disasters such as the Saguenay region and Red River floods."
36th,1st,"Let me mention another source of great pride: the proclamation of the twenty-first of June, the longest day of the year, as National Aboriginal Day -- a day to honour the First Peoples of this land."
36th,1st,A New Parliament...
36th,1st,"Today marks the opening of a new Parliament, the last Parliament of the 20th century and the first Parliament of the 21st century, a Parliament with a unique and historic opportunity to provide leadership on national issues to secure the future for Canadians."
36th,1st,"On June 2, 1997, the people of Canada renewed the mandate of the Government. Over the course of this Parliament, the Government will fulfil the commitments it made to the people in its election platform."
36th,1st,"The Parliament of Canada is the only institution directly elected by all Canadians with the mandate to protect and express the national interest. Elected by all Canadians and endowed with the legitimacy that this bestows, the Government of Canada will stand up for the shared values of Canadians at home and abroad."
36th,1st,"But governing in the 21st century also means recognizing that no one government can act alone. Given the complexity of the issues that face us as citizens in a global economy, collaboration is an essential ingredient for the success of Canada. More than ever, Canadians want their governments to work together in partnership."
36th,1st,"As we look forward to the beginning of a new millennium with new challenges and new opportunities, we can look back at the last century of Canadian history and state with certainty that Canada is rightly regarded, the world over, as an extraordinary success. Canada represents a triumph of the human spirit, bringing together the best of what people can do."
36th,1st,...For a New Century of Canadian Achievement
36th,1st,"As the 21st century approaches, Canadians face changes in technology and information that are as profound as those of the Industrial Revolution and that are creating dramatic opportunities for our growth and development. As old and familiar constraints of time and distance are breaking down, individuals and communities can accomplish things once unimaginable."
36th,1st,Canada is ready. We are poised for success. Our citizens have the qualities that are needed to succeed in the 21st century:

36th,1st,"Our federation makes the most of these talents. It gives us the cohesion we need to multiply our strengths by combining our talents, by pooling our resources and by sharing risks. It also gives us the flexibility we need to experiment and innovate in order to succeed in a rapidly changing world."
36th,1st,"The Government wishes to recognize the important role of a professional, non-partisan public service in a well-performing civil society. Canada is served well by its public service, and the effort and dedication it exhibits in meeting the needs of citizens and in building partnerships among governments and other sectors of society. The Government will continue to renew the Public Service of Canada to ensure its members have the skills and dedication to continue serving Canadians well."
36th,1st,We Have Already Built a Foundation for Our Success 
36th,1st,"In recent years, Canadians worked hard and sacrificed to overcome many of our nation's challenges. We succeeded, and have started to put in place a strong foundation for our success in the new millennium."
36th,1st,"This 36th Parliament opens at a time when we have brought order to our public finances, and the economy is entering a period of strong growth. While unemployment is still too high, hundreds of thousands of new jobs are being created by the private sector, inflation is at very low levels, and interest rates are lower than they have been in more than three decades. More Canadian companies are selling more goods and services to the world than ever before."
36th,1st,"Stimulating job creation and economic growth has been, remains, and will continue to be a major objective of the Government of Canada. The Government will build on the progress achieved and the foundations put in place over the last four years to strengthen the economy and increase confidence. We will pursue this course and take further action to encourage new investment, to create new jobs, and to generate the national wealth necessary to assure Canadians a stable and secure future."
36th,1st,The Government will continue to be vigilant and responsible about keeping the financial affairs of the country in order:

36th,1st,Â 
36th,1st,Â 
36th,1st,Â 
36th,1st,"One in three Canadian jobs depend on trade. Our prosperity and our ability to create jobs are directly linked to how well we capitalize on international opportunities. Team Canada trade missions have successfully generated new opportunities for Canadian businesses and have illustrated what we can accomplish when governments and the private sector collaborate. The Government will build on this success with a focussed strategy, developed in consultation with industry, to improve our international economic performance by expanding Canada's trade base, becoming the location of choice for global investment, and making Canada a preferred tourist destination."
36th,1st,"The Government has regained the ability to address priorities of Canadians while living within its means. It is now in the position to make strategic investments in our children and our youth, our health, our communities, and our knowledge and creativity while continuing to improve the nation's finances."
36th,1st,The Government is committed to following this balanced approach of social investment and prudent financial management as it leads Canada toward renewed and lasting economic health and increased social cohesion.
36th,1st,"As important as all of these accomplishments is the fact that the federal, provincial and territorial governments are developing new and better ways of working together. We are making the federation better able to serve the differing needs of Canadians across the country."
36th,1st,Canadians feel better about their own future and the country's future. We are looking to our future together with a new optimism. The fact that we have demonstrated our ability as a country to set ambitious goals and achieve them gives us new confidence to set higher goals for the
36th,1st,years ahead and succeed. We need to go beyond the limits of our expectations. It is the task of Parliament and the Government to rise to this new spirit of optimism.
36th,1st,Our Challenge for the Future
36th,1st,"Our challenge is to ensure that no Canadian is left behind as the country moves forward. The future belongs to societies whose economy is sound; who invest in knowledge, education and innovation; whose population is healthy; whose children are well prepared to learn; and who focus on securing a high quality of life for all citizens. Canadians have already set these priorities for this new Parliament. These are the Government's priorities."
36th,1st,Building a Stronger Canada
36th,1st,"The federal, provincial and territorial governments owe it to all Canadians to take responsible leadership on the unity of the country. The single most important commitment of the Government is to keep Canada united. The Government of Canada can have no greater duty or responsibility. The overriding goal of the Government of Canada as we approach the 21st century is both simple and ambitious. It is to strengthen and unite this country by joining in the common purpose of keeping Canada one of the best places in the world in which to live."
36th,1st,"Our values of openness, tolerance and sharing, our qualities of social and linguistic diversity, and our high standard of living equip us exceptionally well for the challenges of the new age."
36th,1st,Canadians want a just and sharing society. A prosperous society. A tolerant and highly diverse society. A society that fosters excellence and creativity. Realizing these aspirations fully will require the active
36th,1st,"engagement of Canadians in all walks of life, as well as our institutions, businesses, voluntary organizations and our governments. It will require collaboration and partnership. It will require reaching out."
36th,1st,"The federal, provincial and territorial governments have been developing a more collaborative approach to strengthening and modernizing Canada's social union -- the new National Child Benefit System is an early result of this new approach. In their meeting last week, nine Premiers and the two territorial leaders reiterated their desire for closer co-operation with the federal government in the areas of health care and social policy. The Government welcomes the Premiers' and territorial leaders' continuing interest in working together, and is committed to even closer collaboration on these important issues. As a next step, the First Ministers will meet this fall to work on co-operative approaches to address youth unemployment, health care and social policy renewal."
36th,1st,"The Government will take a very broad and encompassing approach to promoting and strengthening our unity. All its major initiatives will serve to make Canada better and thus more united. The Government will approach its mandate committed to collaboration and partnership with all its partners in Canadian society. Canada provides our common space and our common means for realizing our potential. We would all be forever diminished, forever changed, should we fail to maintain the example Canada provides to the world. Our future as a country is too precious for us to risk losing it through misunderstanding. Therefore, the Government will bring frankness and clarity to any debate that puts into question the future existence or unity of Canada. It will create a better understanding of the true complexity and difficulty for all of us in severing ties that have developed in building a nation together. Most of all, it will demonstrate how much more we can do together than apart."
36th,1st,"The Government will work closely with provincial and territorial governments to further advance the progress made by nine Premiers and the territorial leaders last week in Calgary toward the full recognition of the diversity inherent in the federation, including the unique character of Quebec society."
36th,1st,We will build on the mutual respect Canadians have for one another to achieve our common aspirations for a better future.
36th,1st,Investing in Children 
36th,1st,A country that has decided to invest in its children is a country that is confident in its future. A country that invests in its children successfully will have a better future. One of our objectives as a country should be to ensure that all Canadian children have the best possible opportunity to develop their full potential. We must equip our children with the capacities they need to be ready to learn and to participate fully in our society.
36th,1st,"While families have the greatest responsibility in the nurturing and development of our children, they are not alone. Developing our children requires a concerted effort and partnership by parents, governments, and the private and the voluntary sectors. It requires focussing on what children need to thrive."
36th,1st,"The experiences of Canada's children, especially in the early years, influence their health, their well-being, and their ability to learn and adapt throughout their entire lives. By investing now in the well-being of today's children, we improve the long-term health of our society. Addressing the needs of low-income families with children is therefore a priority of the Government."
36th,1st,"Federal, provincial and territorial governments have agreed to address in a co-operative way the problems of low-income families with children. Together we are now building the comprehensive and effective National Child Benefit System."
36th,1st,"The Government has already demonstrated its initial commitment to this project by increasing its contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by $850 million a year, with higher payments to families beginning July 1, 1998."
36th,1st,The Government will work with its provincial and territorial partners to establish jointly a common timetable for increasing the federal contribution to the Canada Child Tax Benefit by at least an additional $850 million during the course of this mandate. The Government will also work with the provinces and territories to establish the National Re-Investment Framework to guide the re-allocation of our partners' savings into new services and benefits for low-income families with children.
36th,1st,"We can make a difference in the lives of all our children. Children need a substantial investment of time and attention for healthy development; they need strong families; they need safe, supportive communities. The federal, provincial and territorial governments agreed in January 1997 to work together to develop the National Children's Agenda, a comprehensive strategy to improve the well-being of Canada's children."
36th,1st,"Federal, provincial and territorial governments will work together to develop this broader agenda for children, including clear outcome measures by which to gauge success. As part of this national agenda, the federal government will undertake three new initiatives:"

36th,1st,Investing in Quality Care and Good Health 
36th,1st,"For decades, the Canadian health care system has been a source of pride for Canadians: it reflects the fundamental values that Canadians most cherish. Our publicly financed system of health care is recognized at home and abroad as simply the best in the world."
36th,1st,"Nonetheless, there is an increasing anxiety among Canadians about the present state and the future of our medicare system. Citizens worry about whether they will have access to the highest possible quality of health care when they need it. The anxiety arises from a number of sources, including the pace and extent of restructuring that has gone on in recent years."
36th,1st,"The federal government recognizes that this restructuring has been difficult for Canadians and, therefore, it will increase health care funding to the provinces from previously budgeted levels. It will introduce legislation to increase to $12.5 billion a year the guaranteed annual cash payments to provinces and territories under the Canada Health and Social Transfer."
36th,1st,One of our goals as a country must be to continue providing all our citizens with access to the highest possible quality of health care and the other tools they will need to enjoy healthy lives as we move into the 21st century. Canadians have a right to expect their governments to work together in harmony to better meet the shared goals and desires of Canadians for a better health system.
36th,1st,"The Government is firmly committed to a publicly administered, comprehensive health care system that provides universal access to high quality care for Canadians anywhere in the country."
36th,1st,"The Government has a leadership role in preserving and enhancing medicare. It has a constructive role to play as a partner with provinces and other interested parties. The Government will play that role in a spirit of openness, pragmatism and innovation. There are steps that we can and will take to lead the efforts by all governments."
36th,1st,"Preparing Canada for the 21st century means ensuring the medicare system meets the needs of the future. It means responding to emerging issues in health care. Working with its partners, the Government will undertake the following initiatives:"

36th,1st,Â 
36th,1st,Â 
36th,1st,"Canadians recognize that good health depends on much more than medical care. Our social and economic situations also help to determine the quality of our health. As a country, we must increase our efforts to promote healthy lives. The Government will contribute to this goal with an agenda to promote good health. Emphasis will also be placed on those factors that determine the health of a country's population, including the equality of economic and social opportunity for all citizens."
36th,1st,Some of the most urgent health problems today are found in Aboriginal communities. The Government will work with other partners and Aboriginal communities to

36th,1st,"To fulfil other pressing health needs, the Government will expand the Canadian breast cancer initiative, renew the national HIV-AIDS strategy; and double the resources for the tobacco reduction strategy, with a particular focus on community-based programs to prevent young Canadians from starting to smoke and to encourage smokers to quit."
36th,1st,The Government will work with its provincial partners and other interested parties to improve Canadian health information systems to improve decision making about health and health care across the country.
36th,1st,Building Safer Communities
36th,1st,"Safe communities are among the hallmarks of our Canadian identity. While the reported crime rate has decreased for four consecutive years, it is still too high. The Government is committed to ensuring that Canada remains a place where Canadians feel secure in their homes and on the streets of their communities. A safe society depends on strong crime prevention efforts as well as traditional legal responses. Governments around the world are developing community-based crime prevention programs."
36th,1st,"The Government will help protect the right of all Canadians to feel safe in their communities by working with other governments, the private sector and voluntary groups. It will"

36th,1st,Creating Opportunity for Young Canadians
36th,1st,"Today's generation of young Canadians is the best educated in our history. Young Canadians are living in a country well-positioned for opportunities in the new economy. Yet, the level of unemployment among Canadians between the ages of 18 and 25 is unacceptably high. The federal, provincial and territorial governments will act to address this problem, and First Ministers and territorial leaders will be working on this issue when they meet this fall."
36th,1st,"To secure our future as a society, our immediate challenge is to make sure that our young generation makes a successful transition to the world of work, that young people who want to continue to learn have access to education, and that young people who found it difficult getting started in the workplace get a second chance."
36th,1st,"All Canadians have a stake in meeting this challenge successfully. No single sector of society nor any one level of government has all the answers. We must all contribute, each in our areas of competency, to meet the challenge we have set for ourselves. The Government welcomes the action being taken by the private sector, through initiatives such as Career Edge and the Corporate Council on Youth in the Economy, and encourages the private sector to do more. The Government is committed to work with other governments, the private sector, communities and individual Canadians to help equip young people for the future."
36th,1st,"An important role for governments is to ensure the widest possible access to post-secondary education. Canadians are concerned about the increasing cost of higher education, and the resulting debt burden on students. The Government took some important measures to address this problem in its budget of February 1997. The Government will continue to reduce barriers to post-secondary education through further changes to the Canada Student Loans Program, increased assistance for students with dependents, and new scholarships to encourage excellence and to help low- and moderate-income Canadians attend university or college."
36th,1st,"The Government finds it unacceptable that thousands of jobs are going unfilled in high-growth sectors of our economy at the same time as young Canadians are unemployed. The Government will work with the provinces, universities and colleges, the high-tech industry and other rapidly growing sectors to better forecast the number and types of jobs that will be available and to develop a plan for ensuring that people are appropriately educated to fill them."
36th,1st,"Three factors make a significant difference to young people getting started in the world of work -- a good education, a chance at a first job, and a mentor to work with as they establish themselves. The Government will increase its resources devoted to helping youth to make a smooth and productive entry into the world of work. Internship programs have been particularly successful in helping young people get started. These programs will be extended and expanded. Enhanced funding of student summer placements will be continued. In partnership with provincial governments and the private sector, a Canada-wide mentorship program will be developed."
36th,1st,"To help those young Canadians who need a second chance, the Government will develop and expand community-based programs for youth with the greatest difficulty making the transition to the world of work because of low education and skills. These will include establishing multi-purpose Aboriginal youth centres that will provide targeted social and cultural support in addition to increasing work and learning opportunities for urban Aboriginal youth."
36th,1st,"The Government will continue to support efforts of individuals, communities and other governments to improve Canadians' capacity to learn throughout their lives."
36th,1st,Investing in Knowledge and Creativity 
36th,1st,"The revolution in the knowledge and information economy is transforming all sectors of the economy from primary resources to service industries. Canada is well-positioned to be a world leader in the global knowledge-based economy of the 21st century. We have the talent, we have the resources, we have the technology, and we have the institutions."
36th,1st,"By rising to the challenge of mobilizing our resources well, we can enable our citizens to succeed in the global knowledge-based economy. This is how we will spur continuing job creation and sustained growth in our standard of living in the 21st century. The Government is determined to do more to support innovation and risk-taking in Canada and to attract more foreign investment in knowledge-based industries to Canada. We will build creative partnerships between the private and public sectors to accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies in all sectors of the economy."
36th,1st,"With targeted growth strategies, we will build those knowledge-intensive sectors where we are strong and where the opportunities for growth and global leadership is highest. Examples are aerospace; bio-pharmaceuticals; bio-technology in agriculture and fisheries; and the environmental, information, and telecommunications technologies. In particular, the Government will significantly increase the resources allocated to help small and medium-size businesses develop and commercialize new technology."
36th,1st,"The Government will explore innovative policies and measures that give particular attention to increasing opportunity for Canadians in rural communities. It will adapt its programs to reflect the social and economic realities of rural Canada. Further, the Government will redouble its efforts to ensure that rural communities and all regions of Canada share in the economic benefits of the global knowledge-based economy."
36th,1st,"Governments have a crucial role to play in supporting science, technology, and the creation of knowledge. The Government of Canada's endowment of the Canada Foundation for Innovation in partnership with the private sector, the provinces and universities, is helping to build a leading-edge national system of innovation. All levels of government must do more to provide public support for research done in our universities."
36th,1st,"Support for knowledge goes beyond support for university research. Increasing support for the arts makes it possible for Canadian culture to reach audiences at home and abroad. Our movies, books, magazines, plays, videos, music, and multi-media productions speak to us about our experiences at the same time as they present Canadian creativity to the world. Therefore, the Government of Canada will provide increased support to the Canada Council and will make special efforts to support culture at home and to promote trade in Canadian cultural and educational products and services abroad."
36th,1st,"We will make the information and knowledge infrastructure accessible to all Canadians by the year 2000, thereby making Canada the most connected nation in the world. This will provide individuals, schools, libraries, small and large businesses, rural and Aboriginal communities, public institutions, and all levels of government with new opportunities for learning, interacting, transacting business and developing their social and economic potential. For example, we will enhance the voluntary sector's capacity to engage Canadians by improving their access to the technology they need to play a stronger role in Canadian life."
36th,1st,"A connected nation is more than wires, cables and computers. It is a nation in which citizens have access to the skills and knowledge they need to benefit from Canada's rapidly changing knowledge and information infrastructure. It is also a nation whose people are connected to each other. The Government will continue to work with provinces to ensure greater mobility for people with disabilities and to ensure their integration into the economic and social mainstream of Canadian life. The Government will also bring forward measures to strengthen networks among Canadians and to increase knowledge of Canada and understanding among Canadians; these measures will include enhanced exchange programs for young Canadians."
36th,1st,Expanding Opportunities in Aboriginal Communities
36th,1st,"Thousands of years ago, Aboriginal people began building Canada's first communities. Today, by strengthening our Aboriginal communities, we are reinforcing the diversity that makes Canada unique in the world. The Government will"

36th,1st,Looking Outward
36th,1st,"Our country has a tradition of being a responsible, engaged, committed world citizen. This is a key characteristic of our national identity and a source of pride to Canadians. Canada is a force for peace and understanding around the world, for bridging differences, and for finding common ground. Canada espouses the common humanity that binds together the human family."
36th,1st,"This tradition is the legacy of Nobel laureate and former prime minister of Canada, LesterÂ Pearson, whose 100th birthday we mark this year. Canadians want their government to carry on this tradition and give it new relevance as the world enters a new century."
36th,1st,Nothing better illustrates the ongoing commitment to this tradition than Canada's leadership since 1994 in the international effort to ban anti-personnel mines. This Canadian initiative has evolved from a bold idea to be the focus of a large and growing international consensus that will culminate in the signing of an international treaty in Ottawa in December of this year.
36th,1st,"Canada's rich and diverse natural heritage is also a source of national pride and international acclaim. Canadians are both the beneficiaries and the stewards of a land that holds nine percent of the Earth's fresh water, 10 percent of its forests, and 25 percent of its wetlands."
36th,1st,"Canadians both delight in our magnificent environment and fear for its future. Maintaining what is good, and improving what has been degraded, requires constant effort. It is an effort that the Government will make."
36th,1st,"The Government is committed to working in the international community to promote sustainable development and to achieve practical solutions to global environmental problems, such as greenhouse gas emissions and toxic chemicals. It will also continue to address the serious international problem of over-fishing. It is committed to acting at home to reduce our contribution to these problems."
36th,1st,"In this same Canadian tradition of internationalism, the Government will undertake the following initiatives:"

36th,1st,Celebrating the Millennium
36th,1st,"For Canadians, the start of the new millennium represents an historic opportunity to celebrate our achievements as a nation and our hopes for the future. It will be an unequalled opportunity to show ourselves and the world the richness of our diversity, the strength of Canadian values, and the great promise of our future in the 21st century."
36th,1st,"The Government will help build a partnership among governments, communities and citizens to mark the new millennium. Many Canadians have creative ideas and suggestions for millennium projects. There will also be an opportunity for parliamentarians from all parties to participate in developing ideas to mark the millennium."
36th,1st,Moving Forward into the 21st Century
36th,1st,"Almost 100 years ago, Sir Wilfrid Laurier said, ""The 20th century shall be the century of Canada and of Canadian development."" He was right. Today, we have the opportunity for success in the 21st century that is far beyond what Laurier could have ever imagined."
36th,1st,To achieve this success we have more work to do -- work that no one can do alone. Each and every one of us must assume personal responsibility for our community and our country. Our greatest responsibility is to build a new spirit of sharing and mutual respect for a new century.
36th,1st,"By working together, by respecting the value of our diversity, we will secure our future and build a stronger country. We will ensure that our future economic opportunities are sound, our children well prepared, our lives healthy, and our communities strong."
36th,1st,"Each generation has the opportunity to choose the society it wants to leave for its children. The greatest legacy we can leave to our children in the new millennium is a vibrant living legacy that will make Canada a better place: a stronger country with a brighter future and greater opportunities for its young people. By working together, we will build that future."
36th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
36th,1st,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
36th,1st,Honourable Members of the Senate/Members of the House of Commons:
36th,1st,May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
36th,1st,Stay Connected
35th,2nd,"February 27, 1996"
35th,2nd,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate; Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons:"
35th,2nd,"A year ago when I became Governor General, I spoke about the generosity and the compassion of Canadians. I spoke especially of the unsung heroes, the volunteers and helpers who encourage and care for their communities."
35th,2nd,"Since then, travelling to almost every province, I have seen how much Canadians love their country and how generous and open they can be to those in need. I have discovered the great strength of those currents of generosity and compassion."
35th,2nd,"In the schools and the Scout troops and in every part of life, from the nurseries of the newborn to palliative care for the dying, Canadians give endless help to one another. Surely this must be the most giving of countries."
35th,2nd,"We are developing a new award to recognize the unsung heroes of Canada; and hundreds of Canadians have already put forward the names of their fellow citizens, to honour their constant help and their open hearts."
35th,2nd,"On the opening of the second session of this Parliament, and on behalf of the Government of Canada, I make the following brief statements of government policy. The Prime Minister and Ministers will expand on this in coming days. Legislation and other administrative measures will follow."
35th,2nd,2
35th,2nd,"Twenty-eight months ago, Canadians elected a new Parliament and chose a new government. Since then, the Government has acted to meet its commitments to the Canadian people. Ministers have insisted upon the highest standards of integrity and honesty in fulfilling their mandate."
35th,2nd,The Government approaches the second half of its mandate confident that what unites us as Canadians is far greater than what divides us; certain that the values we share as Canadians are as relevant today as they have been at any time during our history; and determined to apply basic Canadian values and principles to the new policies and fresh approaches that are required to prepare ourselves and our national institutions to deal with the challenges of the 21st century.
35th,2nd,"Canadians are concerned about economic uncertainty, the sustainability of social programs and the unity of the country. The scope and enormity of the challenges are such that no individual, municipality, province or region acting in isolation can expect or hope to address them successfully. It will take the will to reason together and to pull together. Each of us must join with those with whom we have the most in common, with whom we share the most at the most basic level-at the level of values. And when we reflect on it, we realize it is with other Canadians that we have the most in common. And when we look at our history, and at our place in the world, we know we can solve our problems."
35th,2nd,Ensuring Opportunity: A Strong Economy
35th,2nd,"A strong economy is the essence of a strong society. A strong economy creates the ability to translate into reality the values of equality of opportunity, compassion for the underprivileged and protection of the vulnerable."
35th,2nd,"Government has a necessary and essential role in facilitating change in society. Many Canadians are concerned about their security, and particularly their security of employment. The Government will work with the private sector and the provinces to make the collective investments required to produce hope, growth and jobs. Because government does not have the resources to do everything, it must be strategic in its approach. It must invest in people. The Government will focus its new initiatives on youth, science and technology, and trade."
35th,2nd,Youth
35th,2nd,Young Canadians want the opportunity to put their energies and talents to use. Young Canadians deserve a climate of opportunity. This must be a national objective.
35th,2nd,"It is time to harness the energy of the Team Canada partnership abroad between the federal and the provincial governments and the private sector to create hope, opportunity and jobs for young people at home. The Government will challenge the provincial governments and the private sector to enter into a domestic Team Canada partnership to create such opportunity for young people. In particular:"
35th,2nd,-The Government will announce measures to double the number of federal summer student jobs this summer. The Government challenges the business community and provincial and municipal governments to do likewise.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will work in active partnership with the provinces, the private sector and young people themselves to prepare initiatives to enhance youth job opportunities so that young Canadians can get work experience."
35th,2nd,-The Government will challenge business and labour and all levels of government to work together to create new approaches to assist young people in finding their first job.
35th,2nd,Science and Technology
35th,2nd,"To create enduring jobs for Canadians in the economy of the 21st century, investment in knowledge and technology is essential. The Government will establish guiding principles to improve the effectiveness and focus of the federal science and technology effort. In particular:"
35th,2nd,"-The Government will make specific proposals to support technology development in the aerospace industry, in environmental technologies, and in critical enabling technologies such as biotechnology. Further measures will be taken to promote technology diffusion, including the launch of a Canadian technology network."
35th,2nd,-The Government will support technological innovation by providing a predictable policy and regulatory framework for the information highway.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will continue to expand the access to the School Net and Community Access programs so that Canadians, particularly those in rural communities, will be able to use technology to increase their knowledge and access to each other and to the rest of the world."
35th,2nd,Trade
35th,2nd,"Canadian jobs and growth depend heavily on our exports. Every one billion dollars of exports means 11,000 Canadian jobs. The success of ``Trade Team Canada'' demonstrates the value of working together to succeed in world markets and therefore create job prospects at home."
35th,2nd,Further ``Trade Team Canada'' missions will be undertaken under the leadership of the Prime Minister.
35th,2nd,"To create jobs at home, the Government will announce new measures to enhance export development and financing, with emphasis on developing new products and new exporters and attracting new foreign investment."
35th,2nd,The Government will continue efforts to expand NAFTA and will work towards more world trade liberalization.
35th,2nd,"Where there are trade disputes, the Government will spare no effort to promote and defend legitimate Canadian trade rights and interests."
35th,2nd,3
35th,2nd,A Climate for Economic Growth and Job Creation
35th,2nd,"In the first half of its mandate, the Government has taken steps to ensure that the economic and fiscal conditions are in place for sustained growth and job creation. The Government has made major structural reforms. The deficit has been cut. International trade and investment initiatives have been undertaken. Much has been accomplished. Canadians are beginning to see dividends, particularly with lower interest rates."
35th,2nd,But the job is not yet completed. The Government will continue to take appropriate action to promote a proper climate for economic growth and jobs. In particular:
35th,2nd,"-The 1996 Budget will set out how the Government will attain its deficit-reduction targets, bringing the deficit down to two percent of gross domestic product in 1997-98 and ensuring that further progress will be realized in 1998-99 and beyond."
35th,2nd,-The Government will work with the provinces to conclude discussions on sales tax harmonization and establish a process to replace the GST and provincial sales taxes with a national sales tax.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will introduce proposals to strengthen the economic framework with legislative improvements in the areas of competition, bankruptcy and copyright."
35th,2nd,-The Government will introduce proposals to update legislation governing financial institutions to ensure that it continues to be relevant to the emerging needs of businesses and consumers.
35th,2nd,-The Government will propose a modernization of the rules governing labour relations under federal jurisdiction through changes in Part I of the Canada Labour Code.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will ensure through regulatory reform that requirements are strong and clear, delays are minimized and activities co-ordinated between departments and between levels of government."
35th,2nd,-The Government is committed to the economic renewal of rural Canada. The Government will address the problems facing rural Canadians in a way that is tailored to their needs. Rural Canada is rich in natural and human resources and faces different challenges than urban areas. The Government will move forward in the coming session to make sure that all Canadians benefit from economic prosperity.
35th,2nd,Ensuring Opportunity: Security for Canadians
35th,2nd,"Economic growth is not an end in itself. Government has the obligation, in accordance with basic Canadian values, to ensure security for Canadians in a rapidly changing world. Our legacy to future generations must include the assurance for all Canadians, wherever they live, that there will be a modern and accessible health care system; that a helping hand will be available when a helping hand is needed; that a public pension system will be there to support people in their old age; that our environment is protected; and that Canadians will be safe in their homes and communities."
35th,2nd,A Secure Social Safety Net
35th,2nd,The Government is committed to ensuring opportunity through a sustainable social safety net for the future. The Government will secure Canada's social union for the future and will adapt our federal arrangements as necessary to meet current challenges and to prepare for the next century. The Government is open to new ways and new directions to pursue our values. In particular:
35th,2nd,"-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians to develop by mutual consent the values, principles and objectives that should underlie, first, the Canada Health and Social Transfer and, building on this, the social union more generally."
35th,2nd,"-The CHST consists of tax points and cash. The Government will announce plans to put a floor under the cash transfer component to provide a guarantee of continuing federal cash to the provinces. This will serve to secure Canada's safety net, particularly medicare."
35th,2nd,Canadians attach high priority to our health care system and to the principles of medicare. The Government reaffirms its unwavering commitment to the five principles of the Canada Health Act. The Government will continue to work with the provinces to ensure the future of our publicly financed health care system.
35th,2nd,Canadians expect to have secure elderly benefits and pensions available to them when they retire.
35th,2nd,-The Government will propose to Parliament measures to sustain Canada's elderly benefits system for the future.
35th,2nd,-The Canada Pension Plan will be made sustainable for future generations. Discussions are already under way with the provinces on possible changes. A joint federal-provincial paper setting out the problems and challenges facing the Plan has already been released for public consultation. And reforms will be legislated once the required provincial consent has been obtained.
35th,2nd,"Equality of opportunity is a basic Canadian value. It begins with children. The Government will announce measures to improve Canada's child support system, with the particular objective of helping single parents and low-income working families."
35th,2nd,Security for Canadians means ensuring that people who are out of work can get help while they are unemployed and can get help to go back to work.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will implement a new Employment Insurance System beginning July 1, 1996. The Government will ensure that the legislation, while respecting the fiscal parameters of the proposed reforms, is responsive to the realities of the Canadian job"
35th,2nd,4
35th,2nd,market and that the impact of changes does not fall unfairly on workers who are most in need of support.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will accelerate its current discussions with the provinces on labour market training and development to ensure the orderly withdrawal of federal activity in training, and to explore new approaches and the appropriate roles and responsibilities of each level of government for strengthening national and local labour markets."
35th,2nd,Environmental Security
35th,2nd,"While sustaining the social safety net is an essential element of security for Canadians, it is not all. The quality of Canada's natural environment is a matter of national pride. Security for Canadians means sustaining our environment. All Canadians must work together to protect the environment. In particular:"
35th,2nd,-The Government will propose the modernization of the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.
35th,2nd,-A federal Endangered Species Protection Act will be introduced.
35th,2nd,-Legislation to ratify the UN Straddling Stocks Agreement and the Law of the Sea Convention will be presented to Parliament.
35th,2nd,-The Government will promote the long-term conservation and revitalization of the Pacific salmon fishery and continue with the revitalization of the east coast fishery.
35th,2nd,National parks are the heritage of a nation. The Government will seek agreements with provincial and territorial governments and with First Nations to establish new national parks and national marine conservation areas.
35th,2nd,The solutions to many environmental problems lie outside our borders. The Government will continue to play an environmental leadership role both at home and in the international arena.
35th,2nd,Personal Security
35th,2nd,"The non-violent character of our country-safe homes, safe streets-is also an essential element of security for Canadians. The Government will focus corrections resources on high-risk offenders while increasing efforts to lower the number of young people who come into contact with the justice system. The Government will develop innovative alternatives to incarceration for low-risk offenders. Criminal procedures will be reformed to better serve victims of crime."
35th,2nd,International Security
35th,2nd,"In an interdependent world, security means taking an active role on the international stage. All Canadians strongly identify with, and take great pride in, the role Canada plays in the world. The Government will continue to work in the G-7, NATO and the United Nations for a more stable and peaceful world. It will pursue a wider spread entrenchment of democracy, and greater respect for human rights."
35th,2nd,"In keeping with its commitment to advancing human rights and dignity, the Government will make the rights of children a Canadian priority and seek an international consensus to eliminate exploitative child labour."
35th,2nd,"The Government will pay special attention to addressing the growing crisis of confidence in the United Nations, which Canadians rightly regard as the most important multilateral organization to ensure international peace and security."
35th,2nd,"Canada will also do its part to help keep and build peace in Bosnia, Haiti, the Middle East and elsewhere."
35th,2nd,A Modern and United Country
35th,2nd,"Canadians have a common history, a common collective experience, a shared territory, and institutions that are uniquely our own. The Government will act to preserve this heritage."
35th,2nd,Canadians also agree upon the values and principles which bind us together and give us confidence in ourselves and in each other.
35th,2nd,"On October 27, the people of Canada came together in their own communities and in Montreal to demonstrate as never before the will to stay together. On October 30, the people of Quebec voted in a referendum to stay in Canada."
35th,2nd,"At the same time, the referendum result gave a clear message that Quebeckers want change in the federation. This desire for change is broadly shared across Canada. The Government will act on a responsible agenda for change for all of Canada."
35th,2nd,"In the last two years, the Government has made significant changes in a number of areas. The Government will work with the provinces and individual Canadians to ensure that the Canadian federation is modernized to meet the needs of the 21st century. This modernization must be respectful of our diversity and be based on partnership and dialogue. Canadians want and expect governments to be flexible and to operate efficiently and effectively so that the country functions well. In particular:"
35th,2nd,"-The Government will not use its spending power to create new shared-cost programs in areas of exclusive provincial jurisdiction without the consent of a majority of the provinces. Any new program will be designed so that non-participating provinces will be compensated, provided they establish equivalent or comparable initiatives."
35th,2nd,"-There are areas where, in the 21st century, the federal government does not have to be involved. For example, components of Canada's transportation infrastructure are being transferred to community-based groups, municipal authorities and the private sector."
35th,2nd,5
35th,2nd,"-The Government is prepared to withdraw from its functions in such areas as labour market training, forestry, mining, and recreation, that are more appropriately the responsibility of others, including provincial governments, local authorities or the private sector."
35th,2nd,"-The federal government will propose to the provinces a much strengthened process to work in partnership, focussing on such priorities as food inspection, environmental management, social housing, tourism and freshwater fish habitat."
35th,2nd,The federal government has an important contribution to make in preserving and modernizing Canada's social union so that the caring society remains Canada-wide in scope. In particular:
35th,2nd,-The Government will work with the provinces and Canadians to develop agreed-upon values and principles to underlie the social union and to explore new approaches to decision making in social policy.
35th,2nd,"-The Government will continue to protect and promote unhampered social mobility between provinces and access to social and other benefits, and will work with the provinces to identify new and mutually agreed approaches."
35th,2nd,The federal government has a major role to play in strengthening the Canadian economy and the Canadian economic union. The Government will work with the provinces to take concrete steps to further improve the functioning of the Canadian economic union. In particular:
35th,2nd,"-The Internal Trade Agreement, which came into effect in July 1995, must be improved. The government will work with the provinces and the private sector to achieve a much more open agreement."
35th,2nd,-The Government is prepared to work with the provinces and other partners to reduce or eliminate remaining barriers to labour mobility.
35th,2nd,"-The Government is prepared to work with interested provinces towards the development of a Canadian Securities Commission, a single food inspection service, and a national revenue collection agency."
35th,2nd,The Government welcomes public participation in the debate about Canada. It will encourage Parliament to reach out to Canadians to seek their views on the specific components of an agenda for change.
35th,2nd,"A First Ministers meeting will be called in the months ahead to discuss how governments can better work together for job creation in Canada, how to secure the social safety net and how to put into place a common agenda for change to renew Canada."
35th,2nd,The Government intends to focus its energies on positive action to prepare Canada for the 21st century. The Government welcomes the commitment of the new government of Quebec to focus all its energies on the real problems of its citizens. The Government will work in collaboration with the Government of Quebec and all provincial governments on an agenda of economic renewal and job creation.
35th,2nd,"But as long as the prospect of another Quebec referendum exists, the Government will exercise its responsibility to ensure that the debate is conducted with all the facts on the table, that the rules of the process are fair, that the consequences are clear, and that Canadians, no matter where they live, will have their say in the future of their country."
35th,2nd,The Government recognizes that national unity is more than a re-balancing of roles and responsibilities of levels of government.
35th,2nd,"At a time of globalization of the economy, Canada is especially well placed to compete because of two official languages and the many Canadians who speak languages other than English and French. The Government recognizes that because of the minority status of the French language in North America, French-speaking Canadians have legitimate concerns. The Government affirms that it is particularly important to reinforce a Francophone presence at home and abroad. Such a presence contributes to our national identity and is a source of strength and enrichment for our country."
35th,2nd,Action has already been taken to recognize Quebec as a distinct society within Canada and to guarantee that no constitutional change affecting any major region of the country will take place without the consent of that region. The Government supports the entrenchment of these provisions in the Constitution.
35th,2nd,"National unity means reminding Canadians of what they have in common. The Government will put forward a series of measures with special emphasis on helping Canadians, particularly young Canadians, to broaden their experience of Canada and to learn more about their country. A new Citizenship Act will be introduced to better reflect contemporary views of the rights and responsibilities of citizenship."
35th,2nd,"Culture is at the core of our identity as Canadians. The Government is committed to strong Canadian cultural industries. The Government will propose measures to strengthen culture in Canada and will ensure continued access to our own cultural products in order to maintain a balance between Canadian perspectives and those from abroad. The Government reaffirms its commitment to ensuring the long-term vitality of the CBC, the National Film Board and Telefilm Canada as institutions which interpret Canada to Canadians and to the world."
35th,2nd,The Government believes that one of the tests of Canadian values is our ability to incorporate the aspirations of Canada's Aboriginal peoples. The recent historic Nisga'a agreement in principle shows that this is possible. The Minister of Indian Affairs
35th,2nd,6
35th,2nd,and Northern Development will continue to pursue other initiatives in partnership with Aboriginal people and other governments.
35th,2nd,Honourable Members of the Senate;Members of the House of Commons:
35th,2nd,"In looking to the 21st century, it is essential that the federal government, in its own policies and programs, be dedicated to providing modern, flexible public services-services that are accessible, affordable and responsive to the needs of clients and citizens. The Government acknowledges the contribution of the Public Service of Canada to the continuing achievement of its goals. Further measures will be introduced to enable more flexible and innovative methods of service delivery."
35th,2nd,"By working in partnership throughout Canadian society to create jobs and economic opportunity, to provide the security of a modern social safety net, and to preserve national unity, the Government affirms that a legacy of hope can be left to future generations."
35th,2nd,Members of the House of Commons:
35th,2nd,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
35th,2nd,May Divine Providence guide all of you in your deliberations.
35th,2nd,Stay Connected
35th,1st,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate, Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons."
35th,1st,"The two and a half years that have passed since I last had the pleasure of addressing Parliament have brought many changes, to Canada and to the world. Our hopes for global peace have been raised and, in many places, shattered. In some countries today, democracy is under stress, its future uncertain."
35th,1st,"Canadians, however, continue their unwavering commitment to democracy. Elections in this country are carried out as peaceful clashes of ideas, not of forces. The very fact that we are gathered in this chamber is, itself, testimony to the durability and wisdom of the process by which we govern ourselves."
35th,1st,"Once again, we look forward to welcoming Her Majesty. This year she will travel to Nova Scotia and the Northwest Territories, and to British Columbia, where she will open the 1994 Commonwealth Games."
35th,1st,"On October 25, 1993, Canadians chose a new Parliament and a new government. The Government has made a number of commitments to the people of Canada. They will be implemented."
35th,1st,"On opening the first session of this Parliament, and on behalf of the Government, I make the following brief statements of government policy, which will be followed by legislation and other proposals by the Prime Minister and Ministers themselves."

35th,1st,"The Government attaches the highest priority to job creation and economic growth in the short term and the long term.

The Government will also implement a Canadian strategy for an information highway."

35th,1st,"Job creation and economic growth also require Canadian firms, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to adopt an aggressive trading mentality to take advantage of export markets. With the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round and the implementation of NAFTA, the Government will assist Canadian companies to translate improved market access into greater export sales. The Government will pursue an activist trade policy so that Canadians may have improved access to expanding markets, particularly in the Pacific Rim and in Latin America."
35th,1st,"The Government will ensure greater cohesion of federal activity in international business development and welcomes the agreement of the provinces at the First Ministers' meeting of December 21, 1993, to explore opportunities for reduced overlap and duplication in this area."

The Government will work closely and co-operatively with the provinces and will consult Canadians on the modernization and restructuring of our collective social security. New legislation will then be placed before Parliament.
35th,1st,The Government will pursue the fiscal discipline necessary for sustained economic growth. The budget will be tabled in February and will include measures to bring the federal debt and deficit under control in a manner that is compatible with putting Canadians back to work. The Government will work with the provinces to ensure that our shared fiscal challenge is dealt with co-operatively and creatively.
35th,1st,"In collaboration with the provinces and as a result of consultations to be undertaken by the House of Commons Standing Committee on Finance, the Government will replace the Goods and Services Tax."

The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act will be proclaimed.
35th,1st,"The East Coast fishery, which has provided a livelihood to thousands of families in the Atlantic provinces and Quebec, confronts significant challenges due to the groundfish resource collapse.

35th,1st,The Government will vigorously pursue its commitment to strengthen the fabric of Canadian life. The Government will introduce measures to enhance community safety and crime prevention.

35th,1st,A Centre of Excellence for Women's Health will be established to ensure that women's health issues receive the attention they deserve.
35th,1st,Prenatal nutrition programs for low-income pregnant women will be created and expanded.
35th,1st,"The Government will forge a new partnership with Aboriginal peoples, particularly in respect of the implementation of the inherent right of self-government. Legislation to further the implementation of northern claims settlements will be put before Parliament."
35th,1st,The Government will allocate additional funds for the support of post-secondary education for First Nations and will develop an Aboriginal head-start program.
35th,1st,Our cultural heritage and our official languages are at the very core of the Canadian identity and are sources of social and economic enrichment. The Government will announce measures to promote Canada's cultural identity.
35th,1st,"The Government will ensure that Canada plays an active, internationalist role in the global arena. In light of the radical changes that have occurred in international affairs in the last few years, the Government will ask parliamentary committees to review Canada's foreign and defence policies and priorities."
35th,1st,"This year will also mark the 50th anniversary of D-Day, and I look forward, on behalf of the people of Canada, to participating in commemorative ceremonies to mark the valiant efforts of our servicemen and servicewomen who participated in the liberation of Europe."
35th,1st,"The Government will work vigorously to fulfil its responsibilities to ensure that federalism meets the needs of Canadians, recognizing that all Canadians share in the responsibility for making Canada work. It will be the policy of the Government to seek to clarify the federal government's responsibilities in relation to those of other orders of government, to eliminate overlap and duplication, and to find better ways to provide services so that they represent the best value for taxpayers' dollars and respond to the real needs of people."
35th,1st,"By working co-operatively to create economic opportunity; by restoring common sense to our public finances; by rebuilding a sense of integrity in government; and by pursuing a positive and innovative agenda for our society, my Ministers are convinced that Canadian unity will be preserved and enhanced. They believe that this Parliament can play a historic role in preparing Canada for the new century to come."
35th,1st,Members of the House of Commons:
35th,1st,You will be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry out the services and expenditures authorized by Parliament.
35th,1st,Honourable Members of the Senate/Members of the House of Commons:
35th,1st,May Divine Providence guide you in your deliberations.
35th,1st,Â 
35th,1st,Stay Connected
34th,3rd,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Honourable Members of the Senate,"
34th,3rd,"Ladies and Gentlemen, Members of the House of Commons."
34th,3rd,It is my great pleasure to greet you as you begin the third session of the Thirty- Fourth Parliament.
34th,3rd,"In the past fifteen months, my wife and I have had the wonderful privilege of meeting thousands of Canadians at Rideau Hall, La Citadelle and in our visits to all of Canada's provinces and territories."
34th,3rd,"Whatever our background and wherever we live, Canadians share the same basic hopes and aspirations. We are proud of the great country we have inherited. Above all, we are determined to leave it a better and stronger place for our children."
34th,3rd,"As Gerda and I meet Canadians, we are moved by the special regard they have for the Queen and for the role she has played in our history. In the nearly forty years since she ascended the throne, she has been served by all seven Canadian Governors General-and she remains a living example of the continuity and stability that are fundamental to our system of government."
34th,3rd,"Therefore, it was a genuine pleasure this year, on your behalf, to congratulate Her Majesty and wish her well on the occasion of her 65th birthday."
34th,3rd,"This session will be a turning point in Canadian history. Let no one doubt the seriousness of the challenges we face as a country. You will have the responsibility and the opportunity to forge an historic accommodation that embraces all Canadians, overcomes division and discord and charts a course for prosperity for generations to come."
34th,3rd,"Last July 1st, when Her Majesty came to celebrate Canada Day with us, she said that the unity of the Canadian people is the paramount issue we face, just as it was at the time of Confederation. And, she went on, ``There is no force, except the force of will, to keep Canadians together.'' I believe that Canadians have that will."
34th,3rd,"I am confident that, as long as we adhere to the values on which this country was founded-belief in human dignity, respect for differences, civility in our dealings with each other-we cannot fail."
34th,3rd,"Canada's history is the history of builders and achievers. Together, Canadian men and women have created a society that is as free and fair as any on earth; ours is one of the oldest functioning democracies, a beacon of freedom to people everywhere. Around the world, Canada is respected for the constructive role we play in global affairs, for the protection we accord human rights, for our tolerance of diversity, for our environmental sensitivity, and for our cultural accomplishments."
34th,3rd,Canada is also envied for our economic prosperity; we rank only thirty-first in population but we have built the world's eighth largest economy. That economic strength allows us to maintain some of the most advanced social programs in the world.
34th,3rd,Millions of people around the world would gladly give up everything they have for the privilege of living in Canada.That is a reality and a response to those who would question the value of Canadian citizenship.
34th,3rd,Canada will celebrate its 125th birthday during this session. Let us ensure this celebration will be looked back upon as a milestone on the road to a united and prosperous future. Let us mark the occasion with the same spirit of confidence and the sense of accomplishment with which we all commemorated Canada's Centennial and Expo 67. We believed then that the potential of Canada was unparalleled. It remains so now.
34th,3rd,"To realize our great promise, we must rebuild Canadian unity and overcome the acrimony, apathy and incomprehension that currently undermine it. In light of the global economic revolution of the past quarter century, we must make the reforms necessary to earn the prosperity that until recently seemed our birthright. And we must address urgently the doubts that have been expressed about the capability of our institutions and processes to achieve these goals."
34th,3rd,"Proposals will be put before you, therefore, that address these three major concerns of the Canadian people and of my government-unity, prosperity and government responsiveness. I am confident that the importance of these issues will persuade all Parliamentarians to put Canada first, set partisan motives and calculations aside and work together for a stronger country."
34th,3rd,Canadian Unity
34th,3rd,"We have been confided the stewardship of this great nation, constructed across an entire continent by generations of men and women determined to make a home for themselves and a future for heir children. They were inspired in their sacrifice by the conviction that tolerance and fairness, courage and compassion, and individual enterprise and neighbourly cooperation could overcome all obstacles and erase all doubts."
34th,3rd,"Now it is the turn of our generation to overcome obstacles, erase doubts and strengthen Canada to meet the challenges of the 21st century. In doing so, we must safeguard the rights of all Canadians and maintain those standards of citizenship that distinguish the Canadian way of life. Some reforms can be achieved through legislation or policy; others require changes to our attitudes; and still others require changes to our constitution."
34th,3rd,"A constitution should unite a nation. Canadians across this country should be able to see themselves and their hopes and aspirations mirrored in their constitution. It is the one document that all Canadians should refer to with pride. That is not presently the case in Canada. And no task is more important than making the constitution a more faithful reflection of who we are, what we represent as a country and what we aspire to be as a people."
34th,3rd,"The Citizens' Forum on Canada's Future was constituted to give Canadians an opportunity to express their hopes and views on the kind of country Canada should be, so we can continue to prosper as we cross the threshold together into a new century. The Special Joint Committee on the Process for Amending the Constitution was established to allow Canadians to be involved in finding a better way of making constitutional changes. Both have increased understanding among Canadians of how much we have in common-as well as awareness of what we stand to lose. Canadians are moving beyond focusing on problems to suggesting solutions."
34th,3rd,"My government looks forward to receiving the recommendations of the two committees by Canada Day, July 1st. The committee reports, together with the work of similar commissions in several provinces and the soundings you have all taken of the views of your own constituents, will give you the understanding you need of what Canadians want done."
34th,3rd,My government will formulate new proposals to focus public discussion on the goal of a more united and prosperous Canada. The proposals will suggest changes in federal and provincial powers and responsibilities and in national institutions. My government will be guided by a number of basic principles:
34th,3rd,"-that Canada has already proven its worth; we seek change in order to improve Canada, not to discard what we have accomplished together;"
34th,3rd,-that the Government of Canada represents all Canadianst; and that change can be achieved only through reasonable compromise and enlightened accommodation of the interests of all Canadians;
34th,3rd,"-that Quebec's unique character must be affirmed and that the particular interests of the West, the Atlantic provinces, Ontario, the North and aboriginal Canadians must be recognized, as well; and"
34th,3rd,"-that the tests of constitutional reform will be fairness, effectiveness, efficiency and the protection afforded to the rights of all Canadians."
34th,3rd,"In September, my government will refer its proposals to a joint parliamentary committee that will be established to consult with Canadians. The committee will be asked to travel in order to hear the views of men and women across Canada. In each jurisdiction it visits, the committee will be mandated to meet in public session with its counterpart provincial or territorial legislative committee or, where no such committee exists, with counterpart legislators. It will, also, meet with aboriginal groups. The committee will be asked to report back to the government within five months."
34th,3rd,"After receipt and consideration of the committee's report, my government will propose a plan for a renewed Canada for consideration by the people of Canada. You will be asked to approve enabling legislation to provide for greater participation of Canadian men and women in constitutional change."
34th,3rd,"My government will work to create a climate in which Canadians can deepen their understanding of their history and traditions and their appreciation of their country's rich diversity. Events planned for 1992, the 125th anniversary of Confederation, will contribute to this greater understanding."
34th,3rd,"The ability of Canadians to live together in harmony and the ability of Canada to make a major contribution to world affairs depend upon our understanding of who we are as a people. To reduce Canada's vulnerability in an age of rapid, even turbulent, change and of growing interdependence, it is more important than ever that we speak to the world with one, clear and united voice. My government will conduct an active foreign policy in support of the full range of Canadian interests around the world-economic and security, environmental and social. My government will continue to promote democratic values and to defend human rights in the conduct of its foreign and development assistance policies as the best means to ensure progress and stability in a changing world environment and to safeguard Canadian security and prosperity."
34th,3rd,Participating in Prosperit
34th,3rd,"My government will invite Canadians to participate in fashioning a new agenda for prosperity. The goal is to build a prosperous society in which all men and women have an equal opportunity to participate, in which benefits and responsibilities are fairly shared and in which the most vulnerable among us are protected."
34th,3rd,There is much more to Canadian unity than amending the constitution. Our unity is strengthened by a strong economy. And prosperity is enhanced by a united country. But disunity in the face of the global economic challenge invites decline.
34th,3rd,"Economic recovery depends on reducing interest rates. To bring interest rates down, government finances have been put on a sound base. My government is controlling its spending and has established low but achievable inflation targets. That is the way to restore the confidence of Canadians in their future."
34th,3rd,"Restored confidence means new investment and new investment means meaningful jobs and a better life for all Canadians. With this fiscally disciplined approach, the economy will recover in the second half of this year and will grow strongly in 1992."
34th,3rd,"Looking to the longer term, Canadians are asking themselves what the future holds for themselves and for their families in a world that is changing so rapidly and profoundly. Deficit reduction, tax reform, free trade and productivity growth are all part of my government's plan to secure the future of Canadians."
34th,3rd,"Canada is inescapably part of the global economy. As citizens of a country that depends for its prosperity on the sale abroad of almost thirty percent of all it produces, the importance to Canadians of being able to compete effectively in international trade can scarcely be overstated. We guarantee our future, not by running from global competition, but by meeting it head-on, by equipping ourselves to compete with the best, by giving ourselves the economic conditions we need to be competitive and by making world markets accessible to our products."
34th,3rd,"The Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement has helped to secure the Canadian economy in difficult times. Private, non-residential investment in Canada, as a share of our gross domestic product, has been taking place at record levels. For the first time in sixteen years, Canada has been attracting more direct investment-the key to job creation and job opportunities-has been going abroad."
34th,3rd,"My government believes North America-wide free trade is a logical next step-and one that would increase the prosperity of all Canadians-if an acceptable agreement can be negotiated with Mexico and the United States. My government will, also, cooperate with Canadian business to take advantage of the growing opportunities for sales and investment abroad as a result of the integration of Europe and of the extraordinary economic growth in Asia. A successful outcome to the multilateral trade negotiations in Geneva would be the best means to guarantee access for Canadian products in markets around the world; achieving that goal will be a high priority for my government."
34th,3rd,"At home, my government will work with provincial governments to ensure that Canada becomes a single, integrated market from coast to coast to coast. We need to eliminate:"
34th,3rd,-policies that favour a province's suppliers over lower cost producers from other provinces;
34th,3rd,-regulations that often make it simpler for producers to ship their products abroad than to sell them in neighbouring provinces;
34th,3rd,-hiring policies that give preference to provincial residents over those from other provinces; and
34th,3rd,-occupational standards that restrict the work opportunities of residents of other provinces.
34th,3rd,"By one recent estimate, there are approximately five hundred barriers to interprovincial trade in Canada. My government's goal is to see barriers to interprovincial trade, services and investment come down by 1995, so that Canada becomes a single, integrated market. The savings to taxpayers and consumers of creating such a market could be as high as six billion dollars-about one thousand dollars a year for a household of four. And a larger home market would allow more Canadian companies to achieve the size and competitive edge to launch themselves successfully into world markets."
34th,3rd,"Today, investment and technology flow with ease across international boundaries, markets for goods and services are specialized and decisions on production are made on a world-wide basis. In the interdependent world we live in, prosperity is more and more a factor of knowledge, skills and innovation. The nations and firms that are succeeding and will continue to succeed in this environment are those whose people are educated, productive and able to adjust to rapidly changing circumstances. The risk for Canada is not so much to be undercut by developing countries with low-wage economies but to be outperformed by technologically advanced countries with highly paid, highly skilled workers."
34th,3rd,"Increasing our productivity across the full range of Canadian industry-resources, and services-is the only way to secure and enhance our prosperity over the longer term. Productivity is the difference between prosperity and decline. The prosperity of all Canadians and our ability to maintain social programs depend on the productivity of Canadians. Increasing productivity requires the collaborative efforts of governments, business, labour and individual Canadians, in all regions. To focus this effort, specific targets will be set."
34th,3rd,"Canadian business, workers and governments will be asked to work together to generate at least two and a half million new jobs by the year 2000 and to raise the real incomes of Canadians by at least twenty-five percent, by the same year. These targets are realistic and achievable in a united Canada, whose population will approach thirty million people by the end of the century and whose gross domestic product will approach one trillion dollars."
34th,3rd,"My government believes that building Canadian prosperity and securing Canada's natural environment are fully compatible goals. International experience demonstrates conclusively that the most economically prosperous nations are also the most environ- mentally conscious nations. To safeguard our natural heritage, my government introduced this country's first comprehensive environment plan-the Green Plan-during the last session."
34th,3rd,"Over the coming months my Minister of the Environment will be implementing a wide range of Green Plan initiatives. These initiatives, in concert with action on the part of the provinces and the private sector, will ensure that Canadians, today and tomorrow, have the clean air, water and land essential to sustaining human health and enhancing our quality of life. They will also encourage the development of ``environmentally friendly'' products for which there are growing markets abroad."
34th,3rd,"We must, all of us, come to grips with the fundamental issues involved in integrating environmental and economic considerations into our decision-making. My government will, over the coming months, consult with provincial governments, industry and environmental leaders to explore means of complementing current regulatory approaches with innovative instruments that would achieve positive environmental results without prejudicing economic prosperity."
34th,3rd,"Increasing economic prosperity is first and foremost an issue of people. Canada's ability to prosper in a global economy will be determined by the level of Canadians' educational achievement, by the sophistication of our management skills and by our attitudes to work and to change. In the dawning knowledge age, how well we live will depend on how well we learn."
34th,3rd,"Canadian men and women must have access to both the skills and the lifelong learning opportunities necessary to improve their job prospects and ensure their own prosperity. But Canadians are questioning whether this country's approach to learning, despite the great dedication of so many talented educators and administrators, is adequate for the times. The issue is not exclusively, or even primarily, money.Canada already spends more money per capita on education than almost any other industrialized nation does. Every year the federal government alone spends about eleven billion dollars, directly and indirectly, on education and training. The issue is results."
34th,3rd,-Three out of ten students drop-out of high school before graduating.
34th,3rd,-Four out of ten adults cannot read or do math well enough to perform everyday tasks.
34th,3rd,"-Canadian industry spends less than half as much on training its employees as American industry does, a fifth as much as the Japanese and an eighth as much as the Germans."
34th,3rd,"This is not the kind of performance that will guarantee increasing prosperity for our children; in fact, it has given rise to concerns whether the next generation of Canadian men and women will be the first to have a lower standard of living than their parents. The time has come to reach a national consensus on performance, goals, partnerships and priorities for learning. As part of my government's new agenda for prosperity, a discussion paper on learning will be published to stimulate and focus discussion on education and training."
34th,3rd,"My government recognizes that education is a provincial responsibility under the constitution and respects that fact. My government also recognizes that Canadians are concerned about education, and would like to see Canada-wide goals established, with provincial endorsement and cooperation, for the year 2000. These goals could include:"
34th,3rd,-cutting illiteracy rates in half;
34th,3rd,-ensuring that ninety percent of Canadians attain high school diplomas or the equivalent by age twenty-five;
34th,3rd,"-doubling the number of post-secondary graduates in mathematics, the sciences and engineering; and"
34th,3rd,-quadrupling the training provided by employers to their employees.
34th,3rd,"Students and parents, employers and employees, educators and governments will be asked to work together to develop a ``learning culture,'' just as we have developed an environmental culture. My government will, also, ask the newly created Labour Force Development Board to present proposals in this area. The objective is to equip Canadian men and women to participate fully in creating and sharing Canadian prosperity."
34th,3rd,"The full participation of Canada's aboriginal peoples in Canada's economic prosperity and political life is a goal shared across the country. To put itself in a position to respond more effectively to the needs of the aboriginal peoples of Canada, my government will appoint the Right Honourable Brian Dickson, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada, to serve as a special representative of the Prime Minister in order to consult widely on the terms of reference and membership of the Royal Commission announced recently and report back to my government."
34th,3rd,"Particular care will be taken to ensure that the Commission neither delays nor negates constitutional, legislative or other reforms already under way. These reforms include land claim settlements, community development initiatives, education and other activities launched during the second session of the Thirty-Fourth Parliament. In cooperation with Indian people themselves, my government will explore alternatives to the Indian Act, especially concerning land, monies and self-government. Finally, my government will consult aboriginal Canadians on changes in the system of administering justice. The goal is to work with Canada's aboriginal peoples so that they control their own lives, can contribute to Canadian prosperity and can share fully in it."
34th,3rd,"Our children are the most important yet most vulnerable members of our society. Last September, at the Children's Summit in New York, the attention of people everywhere was focused on children at risk. Seventy-one leaders pledged that that moment would last a decade. My government will bring forward a plan to implement the commitments it made that day; the objective is to see Canadian girls and boys better educated, better protected and better nurtured so that they can make their own contributions to Canada's future. In addition, my government will review its policies in relation to the family, the most fundamental building block of Canadian society. And my government will appoint a blue ribbon panel of concerned Canadian men and women to inquire into the serious problem of violence against women in our society."
34th,3rd,"My government will lay before you proposals for programs and policies to remove the barriers still faced by disabled Canadians to full participation in Canada's political life and economic prosperity. The government plans to implement a five-year strategy that will resolve issues such as access to employment, training, housing and transportation, public sensitivity and community integration."
34th,3rd,"You will be asked to approve a number of other important legislative initiatives to advance the economic, social and international interests of Canadians. You will, also, be asked to appropriate the funds required to carry on services and expenditures authorized by Parliament."
34th,3rd,Changing the Way Ottawa Works
34th,3rd,"Change is the hallmark of our age; in Europe, in Asia, in Latin America, old assumptions are being discarded and new principles are being adopted. In Canada, too, new problems require new solutions.There is a need for change in the way Parliament does business and in the way governments conduct their affairs. The goal is to ensure that Canadians' agenda is Parliament's agenda."
34th,3rd,"In the Thirty-Third Parliament, a committee of the House of Commons proposed far- reaching reforms to enhance the role of private members. During that Parliament, you implemented more than eighty-five percent of the committee's recommendations. And, at the end of the last session of this Parliament, further changes were passed to make it possible for members to spend more time at home with their constituents so that they can be more effective in representing the wishes of their constituents and more efficient in the conduct of House business."
34th,3rd,"Canadians exercise their democratic freedom by electing their representatives through secret ballot. During this session, you will receive the report of the Royal Commission on Electoral Reform established by my government. Canadians want to know that their elected representatives have the power and authority to represent them. My government will propose further reforms so that all Members of Parliament can fulfil better their obligations to their constituents."
34th,3rd,"The respect of the people for Parliament and Parliamentarians is essential for a healthy democracy. But the appearance, and sometimes the reality, of excessive party discipline and over-zealous partisanship, of empty posturing and feigned outrage have eroded that respect in Canada. Members will be asked, therefore, to consider new procedures for assessing legislation, for raising grievances on behalf of constituents and for questioning government. This will further enhance the role of individual members and afford them greater independence."
34th,3rd,"Change is also necessary in the ways governments conduct their affairs. Governments must be both effective and efficient, implementing necessary programs at the lowest cost to taxpayers. Canadians understand that their governments simply cannot afford to do everything that is demanded of them. In the past six and a half years, through prudent management, the growth of government operations has been curtailed. My government has privatized and eliminated twenty-four Crown corporations and streamlined virtually all government departments and agencies. Since 1984, ninety thousand employees have been removed from the payroll of the federal government and its agencies. During this session, my government will take that process further. A draft spending control bill to cap federal program spending will be referred to a parliamentary committee for consultations with Canadians. Legislation will also be introduced to create a debt servicing and reduction fund so that GST revenues, as well as monies from further privatization of Crown corporations and from voluntary contributions, will be used to service the national debt. Streamlining of government structures and operations to serve Canadians better and to save taxpayers' money will continue to be a priority of my government."
34th,3rd,"Better ways to conduct the business of government are being examined. Improvements in the management of the public service, started under the Public Service 2000 initiative, will continue. A public service reform bill will be introduced into Parliament in support of this renewal program. Additional special operating agencies will be created to provide better service to Canadians through more autonomy and a sharper focus on objectives. My government will, also, continue to privatize those government activities best done by the private sector, as well as wind up and consolidate other agencies in order to provide Canadians better value for their tax dollars."
34th,3rd,Conclusion
34th,3rd,"You are meeting at a pivotal period in the life of Canada, a time to reinvigorate our country and to bring Canadians together in a renewed accommodation. My government will work with Canadians to achieve its goals of unity, prosperity and responsive government so that all Canadians feel themselves a part of this country, so that all Canadians have an equal opportunity to share in its bounty, so that all can see themselves reflected in its constitution and so that all will find the fulfilment of their aspirations in its future."
34th,3rd,"Honourable Members of the Senate, Members of the House of Commons, Ladies and Gentlemen, you will play a decisive role in the strengthening of Canada. History will be the judge of the decisions you make on these critical issues."
34th,3rd,May Divine Providence be your guide.
