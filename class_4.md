### Class 4: Data visualisations
We will talk about how to visualize data, and the appropriate types of visualizations for different types of data.

*Readings*
- [R4DS, Chapter 3](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html) (introduces the ggplot2 package for graphing data)

*Lab*
- Work with a real data set. Get it, manipulate it, and visualize the results.
- We will work with data from the [UN of refugee flows](http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=refugees&d=UNHCR&f=indID%3aType-Ref)
    * Graph refugee intake to Canada over time.
    * Graph countries of refugee intake to Canada in 2016.
    * Graph refugee outflows in top 10 refugee-producing countries over time.
- We will work with data from the most recent Labour Force Survey, available on [ODESI](https://search1.odesi.ca/#/)
    * Graph the average male and female hourly wage for individuals from 25 to 34 years old with a Bachelor's degree or above who are employed and at work, according to their occupation (NOC_10).
    * Graph the average wage according to the amount of eduction the responded has, for males between 35 and 44.  Facet the graph by province.

*Homework*
- Obtain the 2015/16 General Social Survey from ODESI.
- Make a plot that illustrates the average subjective well-being (SLM_01) for males and females by age, such that it is possible to compare between males and females.
- Make a plot that illustrates the percent of people that say that life is "A bit stressful" or more, according to how much income they report.
- Make sure that both of your plots are well-labelled and clear.

*Additional resources*
