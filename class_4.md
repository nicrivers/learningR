### Class 4: Review of basic concepts in research methods
We will be building on your prior background in research methods.  This class will be a brief refresher of some concepts that you have already learned.  Before coming to this class, you should refresh your memory on these topics.  You can use any textbook, but you should ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts:
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
- Measures of variation: standard deviation
- Distributions of variables; especially the normal distribution
- Inference about the population based on a sample
  - Hypothesis testing: what is it? How do you do it?
  - Standard error, p. value, confidence intervals

*Readings*
These topics are covered in:
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Ch. 5-7.
- They will also be covered in the text you used for your first research methods/statistics class.
- Go through these [excercises to refresh your understanding of basic concepts in research methods] UPLOAD MATERIALS HERE.

*Lab*
- We will review these concepts in class.

*Homework*
- Download the 2016 Canadian Census PUMF Individuals file from ODESI.
- Filter the data so that it excludes non-permanent residents and people who do not declare their immigration status.
- Filter the data so that it includes only females 40-44 years old.
- Filter the data so it only includes people that have income from wages greater than $1. Drop people for whom wage data is missing (see codebook).
- Compare the mean wage for immigrants to non-immigrants for this group of people.
- How confident are you that there really is a difference in wages for immigrants and non-immigrants based on this sample? (conduct a t-test to find the answer).
- Submit your work in a Word or HTML file that you create with RMarkdown so that both your code and results are visible.
