## Novel data sources

In this class, we will explore how to turn text into data that can be used in analysis such as we have learned in this class.

## Lab:
- We will go through some fun visualization of all the [MP speeches that were made in the 2018 house of commons debates](https://github.com/nicrivers/uo_api_6319/raw/master/hoc2018speeches.zip).
- The notes for the exercises we will go through are [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nicrivers/uo_api_6319/blob/master/text_mining.html)
- Depending on time availability, we may also look at [speeches from the throne](https://github.com/nicrivers/uo_api_6319/raw/master/sfft.csv).


## Homework:
- There is no homework this week: work on your presentation for next week.
