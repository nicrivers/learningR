## Class 2: Research design

Our class this week will focus on cause and effect.  We will talk about randomized controlled trials and observational studies, and when it is possible to make causal conclusions from these different research designs.  We will introduce "hurdles" that a research design must clear to claim a causal effect.  We will discuss research designs as comparisons, and introduce some alternative research designs to use in observational settings.

*Readings*
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Ch. 3
- World Bank, Ch. 3 ([link](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/698441474029568469/pdf/108270-PUB-Box396299B-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-9-13-16.pdf))

*Lab*
- Our lab this week will focus on choosing a research topic and an appropriate research question.
- You should come prepared to discuss your research interests, and in particular to discuss an *empirical* research question/hypothesis that you could work on this semester.

*Detailed topics*
- What is cause and effect in the social sciences?
- Four hurdles to establishing causality
- What is a research design? Experiments (with random assignment) vs. observational studies.
- Why random assignment helps for establishing causality.
- Establishing causality in observational settings.
- Multiple regression as a concept.

*Homework*
??? One-page write-up. One paragraph basic topic (why is it interesting). One paragraph research question/hypothesis. One paragraph on the type of data you would require to test the hypothesis.  One paragraph on a research design/comparison that could be used to test the hypothesis. ???Group work OK???
