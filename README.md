# Welcome to API 6319

This website hosts course resources, including readings, data sets, and resources for learning R.  I will keep this site updated throughout the semester.

## Course syllabus

The course syllabus is available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vv7eqs66glayji/Detailed%20course%20syllabus.docx?dl=0).

## Course materials

### Class 1: Introduction
Our class this week will include some discussion of what to expect during the course, including how to prepare for classes, assessment methods, topics, software, etc.  We will also discuss quantitative research, talk about cause and effect, and discuss what types of research questions it is possible to answer with the methods and research designs we will cover in the class.

*Readings*
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Ch. 1

*To do before class*
- Install R ([link](https://cloud.r-project.org/))
- Install RStudio ([link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/))

*After installing both of these, you should ensure that when you click on the RStudio icon, it opens up.*

*Lab*
- Our lab this week will cover basic R functionality.  Key topics are presented [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nicrivers/uo_api_6319/blob/master/R_session_1.html)
- [R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), chapters 4 and 6 cover some of the same material.


### Class 2: Research design
Our class this week will focus on cause and effect.  We will talk about randomized controlled trials and observational studies, and when it is possible to make causal conclusions from these different research designs.  We will introduce "hurdles" that a research design must clear to claim a causal effect.  We will discuss research designs as comparisons, and introduce some alternative research designs to use in observational settings.
*Readings*
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Ch. 3
- World Bank, Ch. 3 ([link](http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/698441474029568469/pdf/108270-PUB-Box396299B-PUBLIC-PUBDATE-9-13-16.pdf))

*Lab*
- Our lab this week will focus on choosing a research topic and an appropriate research question.
- You should come prepared to discuss your research interests, and in particular to discuss an *empirical* research question/hypothesis that you could work on this semester.

### Class 3: Review of basic concepts in research methods
We will be building on your prior background in research methods.  This class will be a brief refresher of some concepts that you have already learned.  Before coming to this class, you should refresh your memory on these topics.  You can use any textbook, but you should ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts:
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
- Measures of variation: standard deviation
- Distributions of variables; especially the normal distribution
- Inference about the population based on a sample
  - Hypothesis testing: what is it? How do you do it?
  - Standard error, p. value, confidence intervals
  
These topics are covered in:
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Ch. 5-7.

*Data sets*
- We will work with the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey, available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/urqpyqpcde84g5c/cchs-82M0013-E-2015-2016-Annual-component_F1.csv?dl=0).
- We will work with the 2015 Canadian General Social Survey, available [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pwcmcbh51hd4830/gss-89M0034-E-2015-c-29-main.zip?dl=0).


### Class 4: Data sources, obtaining and manipulating data
To test a theory, you need data. This class will talk about where and how to obtain data.  We will look at publicly available data sets from the World Bank, Statistics Canada, and others.  We will talk about both micro-data (on individuals) and aggregate data (on regions).  We will also talk about how to work with data, including filtering it, merging multiple data sets together, grouping and summarising, and creating new variables based on data.

*Readings*
- R4DS, Chapter 5: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html (introduces the dplyr package for manipulating data)

### Class 5: Data visualisations
We will talk about how to visualize data, and the appropriate types of visualizations for different types of data.

*Readings*
- R4DS, Chapter 3: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html

*Resources*
- Examples of graphs and code to reproduce them: https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/
- Graphics for communication, R4DS, Chapter 28: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html (explains how to use advanced features of ggplot2 to enhance graphs)
- What makes a good graph?: http://socviz.co/lookatdata.html#lookatdata (discussion of how to design your figures)
