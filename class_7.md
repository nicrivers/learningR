## Multiple regression

In multiple regression, you can estimate the relationship between a dependent and independent variable while *controlling* for other factors.
Multiple regression is the main tool in the toolbox of the applied empirical researcher in social sciences.

### Readings:
- Kellstedt and Whitten, Chapter 9.

### Lab:
-

### Homework:
- In the 2019 US State of the Union Address, Donald Trump said, "Tonight I am asking you to defend our Southern border... Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders... Meanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal immigration -- ... increased crime, ..."
- Your objective is to use data to test whether Donald Trump's assertion -- immigration causes crime -- stands up to scrutiny.
- The data is on crime rates in Toronto from the uniform crime reporting system and on characteristics of census discricts from the 2006 census.  The data is [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nicrivers/uo_api_6319/master/toronto_crime.csv).
- Use the data to estimate a model that relates the rate of crime (violent/property) on the immigration rate, controlling for other factors.
- What is your conclusion?  Can the model you estimated tell us whether immigration *causes* crime (why or why not)?
