### Class 5: Review of basic concepts in research methods
We will be building on your prior background in research methods.  This class will be a brief refresher of some concepts that you have already learned.  Before coming to this class, you should refresh your memory on these topics.  You can use any textbook, but you should ensure that you are familiar with the following concepts:
- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, mode
- Measures of variation: standard deviation
- Distributions of variables; especially the normal distribution
- Inference about the population based on a sample
  - Hypothesis testing: what is it? How do you do it?
  - Standard error, p. value, confidence intervals
