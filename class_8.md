## Regression extensions

In this class, we will build on the basic multiple regression framework with some extensions:
- dummy variables
- variable transformations (log transforms)
- variable interactions

If we have time, we will also consider how to deal with situations in which the dependent variable is categorical, by estimating probit or logit models.
