## Class 10: Longitudinal data and difference-in-difference

The most commonly applied method to assess the impact of a policy or other economic or political event is the "difference-in-difference" approach.
We will understand the method, and apply it in this class.

## Lab:
- Difference-in-difference examples (traffic accidents and beer tax?)

## Homework:
- In September 2014, Ontario finished rolling out full-day kindergarten to all schools in the province.  For this week's homework, you will assess the effect of this policy on labour force participation of mothers of young children, using a difference-in-difference research design.
- The data for the assignment is assembled from multiple waves of the Labour Force Survey. The data includes monthly responses that capture labour force status (employed or not) of individual women, before and after the introduction of the policy, in Ontario as well as other provinces.  The data is available on the course website.
- Produce a plot that compmares female employment rates over time in Ontario compared to other provinces in Canada.  Show the introduction of the full-day kindergarten policy in the graph.  Properly label your plot.
- Conduct a difference-in-difference regression analysis to estimate the impact of the policy on employment.  Try models with and without controls for confounding variables.  Explain your findings.
- Do these results capture the causal effect of the full-day kindergarten program on female employment?  Why or why not? (4 hurdles)
